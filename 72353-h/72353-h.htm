<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirteen">XIII.</abbr></h3>
<h4>SOPHY MEREDITH.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> a garden, the garden of a large old-fashioned
house on Highgate Hill, a girl
sat with a book in her hand, dreaming, on
a July afternoon.</p>

<p>The scene was a thoroughly English one.
Behind the garden-seat rose the gray brick
walls of the house. It was old without being
in the least degree venerable, ugly without
looking positively mean. Its size redeemed
it from that—its size, and a certain air of
comfortableness that belongs only to English
homes. High walls shut out the sight of the
new garish houses of red brick, and the
sounds from the road, which of late years had
become very much like a street. Within the
lofty garden walls, order, comfort, propriety
were supreme—they were not likely to be replaced
by any other principles so long as
Sophy Meredith reigned at Grove House.
The lawn exactly resembled a carpet; not a
weed was to be seen in gravel-walk or in
flower-bed; the rose-trees had just so much
liberty as would prevent their appearing
formal, not a fraction more. But the
principle of order was, after all, subservient
to that of comfort. Books and
magazines, garden-chairs, and bits of
feminine ‘work’ lay about. On one side
stood an invalid’s chair.</p>

<p>Sophy lay back on the garden-seat, her
hands clasping the half-closed book on her
lap. She was no longer a girl, being now
seven-and-twenty; but she had one of those
smooth, fair complexions which take ten years
off a woman’s apparent age. Her features
were not striking, but very pleasing, and
suited well her slight figure and her low forehead.</p>

<p>As if unable to sit still any longer, she
rose and passed into the house through a
French window which was standing wide
open. The drawing-room, like the garden,
spoke of orderly comfort. Everything was in
its place, yet one could not say that the room
or its furniture had an air of stiffness. Crossing
over to the mantelpiece, Sophy lifted a
letter-weight which had been placed above
some neatly folded papers, and took from
under it a telegram. She blushed slightly as
she opened it, for she knew it by heart already.
It was dated on the previous evening, and
contained only the words: ‘Shall be with you
to-morrow <span class="lock">afternoon.—Hubert.’</span></p>

<p>This quiet dwelling was Hubert Blake’s
home, the only home, at least, that he had
ever known, though he generally lived in his
chambers in London. His uncle, who had
been his guardian, was now an old man and
an invalid, or rather, a valetudinarian. He
had been for the last ten years a widower;
and Sophy Meredith, his wife’s niece, had
managed his household and seen to his
comfort since his wife’s death. Hubert and
she had been, of course, thrown very much
together. They called each other ‘cousin,’
though they were not really related to one
another, and corresponded at intervals, sometimes
in long, chatty epistles, oftener in brief
notes.</p>

<p>Four years had passed since Hubert had
despatched those long letters from the Castle
Farm; and for the last two years the inmates
of Grove House had heard very little
from him. He had been wandering over the
face of the earth, trying to find occupation,
excitement, anything to drive Margaret Lindsay’s
image out of his head.</p>

<p>After meeting her at Arrochar three years
ago, he had thought himself cured of what he
told himself was a halfinsane passion. He
saw plainly that Margaret was not suited to
him. Her mental powers, though considerable,
were totally undeveloped. The world
of literature and that of art were as unknown
to her as the world of fashion. It would be
an act of folly, he knew very well, to tie himself
to one with whom he had so little in
common, and who was so little likely to be
moulded by any man as Margaret Lindsay.
So he did not follow her back to Castle Farm.
He stayed at Arrochar for a few days, and
then wandered westwards.</p>

<p>But the girl’s face haunted him. At times
he was consumed with a desire to make this
stately, simple, self-sufficient beauty his own,
to feast his eyes continually on her loveliness,
to watch her unfolding mind as she was
brought into new scenes and surrounded with
new ideas. He felt as if he could not live
without seeing her again. Accordingly he
ran down to Scotland a third time, and
(under cover of his friendship with her
brother) spent some days in her company.</p>

<p>But her presence did not satisfy him. She
was cold, narrow, unsympathetic, as she had
always been. He went abroad, determined to
stay away till he should forget her. Now, at
last, he was coming home.</p>

<p>Sophy, having read the welcome telegram
two or three times, as if to assure herself of
its truth, replaced it under the paper-weight,
and then left the room, going into the hall.
Opposite her was a broad flight of shallow
steps, and these she ascended. Going a little
way along a corridor, she came to a door, which
she softly opened. It led to a large bedroom
with a wide window, which commanded a
view of the greater part of London; this was
the room which Hubert always occupied when
he was at Grove House.</p>

<p>With something that was not exactly a
blush, Sophy moved noiselessly from the
dressing-table to the writing-table, seeing
that nothing had been omitted. Everything
was in its place; everything was spotless
and fragrant. There was nothing to be
supplied, nothing to be altered; and yet
the girl looked as if she must do something.
She went back to the garden, picked
a single red rose, and then, going up to the
second floor, she visited her own bedroom, and
took out of a closet a slender glass vase. It
had been presented by her to Hubert long ago;
boy-like, he had forgotten it, and, indeed, it
was not a very suitable present for a lad.
Sophy took the neglected vase, placed the
rose in it, and carried it down to her cousin’s
writing-table.</p>

<p>She was leaving the room when she heard
a querulous voice calling her, and she hastened
to the end of the corridor, and entered Mr.
Blake’s sitting-room. He was a thin,
tremulous, dried-up looking old man, who
looked as if he were in a state of perpetual
anxiety.</p>

<p>‘Is that you, Sophy?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, uncle.’</p>

<p>‘Has Jackson gone with the brougham to
meet Hubert?’</p>

<p>‘Not yet, uncle.’</p>

<p>‘Not yet! Why haven’t you sent him
off?’</p>

<p>‘The train is not due till 5.30.’</p>

<p>‘Let him go at once!’ interrupted the old
man. ‘I wouldn’t have him late on any
account. I wonder, Sophy, you haven’t
more consideration for Hubert, when he has
been so long away, than let him run the
risk of finding no one to meet him at the
station.’</p>

<p>Sophy turned away to carry out her uncle’s
wishes with a half-sad, half-contemptuous
smile about her lips.</p>

<p>The afternoon was a tiresome one, but it wore
itself away at last; and the carriage made its
appearance. Before it had time to stop,
Hubert sprang out and grasped his uncle’s
hand, while he held out his left to Sophy.
Then, disengaging his right hand, he placed it
upon hers, and bending down, kissed her
cheek.</p>

<p>‘What a long time you have been away!’
exclaimed old Mr. Blake, as soon as the first
greetings were over. ‘We thought we should
never see you again.’</p>

<p>‘Well, here I am, and I don’t intend to
run away in a hurry.’</p>

<p>‘How changed you are! You look older,
and you have let your beard grow longer. I
never approved of beards. I think they give
a man a coarse, common appearance.’</p>

<p>Hubert laughed, and busied himself in
carrying various packages into the house,
while Sophy glanced shyly at her cousin, at
moments when she was not likely to meet his
eye.</p>

<p>After dinner they all returned to the
garden, and Hubert fetched a box which had
just been opened.</p>

<p>‘I’ve picked up a few little things I
thought might interest you, while I was
away,’ he said; and he proceeded to unpack
his treasures and present them.</p>

<p>For his uncle there were several antiques,
one or two rare coins, and a silver crucifix;
for Sophy two or three mosaics, some beautiful
bits of Venetian glass, and two brooches—one
a cameo, the other a piece of old-fashioned
workmanship in plain gold.</p>

<p>Sophy thanked him, but she felt disappointed.
She had thought it likely that he
would bring her some little thing, and she had
unconsciously resolved that she would keep it
as long as she lived. These presents were too
fine, too valuable, and there were far too many
of them. She could not invest any one of
them with a special interest. If she did, it
would be her own selection, not his.</p>

<p>‘And what have you been about, little one,
all this time?’ he asked, laying his hand suddenly
on Sophy’s, as it lay on the garden-table.</p>

<p>‘Oh, nothing very remarkable,’ she answered,
quietly withdrawing her hand. ‘We
went to the Academy, of course, and to the
Grosvenor—and to a Rose Show; and I have
been to one or two garden-parties.’</p>

<p>‘We were thinking of going to the seaside
next week,’ put in Mr. Blake; ‘but we can’t
find a house to suit us; and the drainage is
always imperfect at these places—always.
Some of those seaside resorts I consider
nothing else than fever-traps. My wonder
is that the people who stay there are alive.’</p>

<p>This was said with a judicial solemnity.</p>

<p>‘If you had been in some of the towns I
have visited, uncle, you would have had more
cause for wondering. The drainage, I believe,
was simply non-existent.’</p>

<p>Mr. Blake closed his eyes and shuddered.</p>

<p>Sophy rose to fetch something from the
house.</p>

<p>‘If there are any letters for me, Sophy,
you might bring them along,’ said Hubert.</p>

<p>Presently Sophy reappeared, bearing a tray
on which was a pile of letters and newspapers.
Hubert sprang up to relieve her of
it.</p>

<p>‘I had no idea there could be so many, or
I wouldn’t have troubled you,’ he said, looking
at the heap with an air of disgust.</p>

<p>Then he lit a cigar, and sat down again.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t you going to open your letters,
Hubert?’ said his uncle, after a pause.</p>

<p>‘No; there’s such a heap of them, and
some are sure to be annoying. It will do
quite as well to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Some of them may be important,’ rejoined
the old man, after another pause.</p>

<p>Hubert saw that his laziness displeased the
querulous old gentleman, so he began slowly
to open his letters.</p>

<p>‘I think the man should have been hanged,’
he said between the puffs of his cigar, ‘that
invented penny stamps. I don’t mean Sir
Rowland Hill. It was another man—poor
beggar, I forget even his name—who had
the idea, and the man in office got all the
glory and all the reward—<i lang="la">tulit alter honores</i>.
As for Hill, he got a fortune and various ugly
statues for an evil deed he never committed.
Well, if these things are all to be set right
one day, there’s a good deal of clearing up to
be done—that’s all. What’s this? A card
for Lady Baldwin’s garden-party—“thought
it possible you might be home in time; hope
to have the pleasure of your company”—ah!
What one misses by going abroad!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed,’ said the old gentleman; ‘and
I hope you won’t leave this country again, so
long as I live. It may not be very long.’</p>

<p>‘Then I should stay at home permanently,’
returned Hubert, knowing well enough that
none like better to be assured of a long life
than they who are fond of referring to their
approaching end.</p>

<p>‘Another invitation, and another—a bill,
a circular, another circular. Some people
grumble at getting circulars; I like them.
It’s so pleasant to open a letter you expect to
have to answer, and find that you may drop it
at once into the basket with a clear conscience.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t encourage me to write to you
often,’ said Sophy, with a little laugh.</p>

<p>‘But he doesn’t mean you, my dear,’ said
the invalid.</p>

<p>‘Mean Sophy? Oh yes, particularly,’
said Hubert half absently, looking up from
a letter he was reading.</p>

<p>Sophy knew, of course, that he was speaking
ironically; but somehow she wished he
had chosen to put the thing the other way.</p>

<p>‘Well, you have one interesting correspondent,
at any rate,’ said Mr. Blake, who never
could refrain from commenting upon the
smallest actions of those near him.</p>

<p>Hubert made no reply. He was reading
the letter a second time, while his cigar
slowly went out. When he had finished it,
he put his cigar into his mouth without
noticing that it was unlighted, and sat silent,
leaning his cheek on his hand. Sophy knew
very well what letter he had been reading—at
least, she knew the post-mark on it—and her
heart beat faster as she bent her head over
her work, and listened for Hubert’s next
words.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid, sir,’ he said at length, ‘you
will think me ungrateful for your kind welcome;
but I think I must run off to-morrow
for a day or two. It’s one of my Scotch
cousins,’ he added apologetically, seeing a
look of grave displeasure on his uncle’s face.
‘He is in trouble of some sort, and he seems
to think I can be of use to him.’</p>

<p>‘But that’s no reason for your hurrying off
to Scotland before we have had time to look at
each other,’ said the old gentleman peevishly.
‘It’s very unreasonable of him to expect such
a thing.’</p>

<p>‘I think if I am to be of any use I must
go at once,’ said the younger man, again unfolding
Alec Lindsay’s letter.</p>

<p>‘If you are thinking of coming north after
your return to England,’ ran the letter, ‘I
wish you would come as soon as you can. I
feel as if a crisis in my life were approaching,
and as if I were all unprepared to meet it.
I need a friend at my side. My father has
set his heart on my becoming a Presbyterian
minister; and as I took my degree in May, he
thinks my next step will be to enter one of the
Free Church Colleges. I shall do nothing of
the kind; and I told him so as civilly as I
could, but he seems to think he can break
down my resolution. I believe he would be
content if I were to take a place under Semple
(you remember meeting him?) in my uncle’s
oil-works; but I am nearly as unwilling to do
that as to don the Geneva gown. The worst
of it is, my father’s reproach that I don’t
know my own mind is true enough. And yet,
I am sure I have no desire to lead an idle life.
I wish you were here to advise me. Do you
think I should have any chance at the English
bar? Everybody says there is not the
slightest opening at the Scotch bar; but I
know so little of the world!’</p>

<p>‘You do indeed, poor fellow!’ was the
reader’s inward comment. But Hubert was
deceiving himself when he ascribed his sudden
resolution to set off for Scotland to a desire
to see Alec Lindsay through his difficulties;
or rather, he refused to listen to the whisper
in which his heart told him that if he went
to the Castle Farm he would in all probability
find Margaret there. He had forced himself
to stay away from Scotland for two years; he
had come back to England (as he thought)
cured of his passion; and at the first reasonable
excuse the other half of his nature, the
half which had so long been denied a hearing,
sprang up and refused to be suppressed. ‘At
least go down to see her once more. You do
not need to stay long, but to spend a day or
two at the farm will hurt no one, and you
may be of service to Alec.’</p>

<p>Thus spoke his heart while his judgment
condemned; and Sophy, glancing at him,
guessed something of what was going on in
his mind. She had not failed to notice how
her cousin (as she called him) had found his
way down to Scotland again and again; and
when she saw among his letters one bearing
the Muirburn post-mark, she told herself that
if he went to the north shortly after coming
home she would know that her guess had
been a right one. But she had not expected
that before he had been four hours in the
house he would have decided upon making
the journey, and it was in a cold indifferent
tone that she asked Hubert whether he
thought of making an early start.</p>

<p>‘If I take the 7.15 from Euston,’ he replied,
‘I can get to the farm the same evening. I
had better do that; but don’t make any
alteration in your usual arrangements. I can
easily get a cup of coffee at the railway
station.’</p>

<p>When he came downstairs next morning,
however, Sophy was tranquilly presiding over
a well-furnished breakfast-table.</p>

<p>‘Hullo!’ he exclaimed; ‘I really don’t
want anything. But how awfully good of
you, Soph, to take so much trouble.’</p>

<p>‘It’s no trouble at all,’ said she coldly, and
with the faintest vestige of a smile. ‘I very
often get up at half-past five these summer
mornings; and I’m glad of an excuse for
having breakfast so early.’</p>

<p>They sat down together for a hurried meal,
and Hubert began to talk in a more excited
manner than was usual with him. Sophy,
however, answered only by monosyllables.</p>

<p>‘How is my uncle to-day?’ he asked;
‘oh! I forgot; you can’t tell. I suppose he
isn’t awake yet. He seemed rather depressed
last night.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it was the reaction after the
excitement of your coming home. And I
think he was hurt at your leaving again so
soon,’ she added.</p>

<p>She was angry at herself for having said
this as soon as the words had left her lips;
but Hubert did not seem to mind her.</p>

<p>‘I’ll be back in a day or two,’ he said,
without looking up.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said beyond the
civilities of the table, till it was announced
that the cab was at the door. Then Hubert
started up in a fever to be gone.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, Sophy; you may look for me
in—oh! I’ll write, or wire, and let you
know.’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, and a pleasant journey,’ she
returned; but she did not offer to go into the
hall to see him off.</p>

<p>Hubert noticed the coldness of her
manner.</p>

<p>‘Can I have offended her in any way?’ he
said to himself. ‘Surely <em>she</em> is not such a
baby as to be annoyed at my leaving so soon.
I told them I had a reason.’</p>

<p>Meantime Sophy, standing well back from
the windows, watched her cousin get into his
hansom. He looked back and waved his
hand, but there was no response.</p>

<p>‘I fancy,’ he mused to himself as the cab
drove off—‘I fancy girls in our rank of life
get stiffer and more conventional every year.
What harm would there have been, now, in
Sophy coming to the door to see me off? I
suppose it’s because she hasn’t a chaperon.
It’s a pity when people allow themselves to
be twisted out of shape by conventional rules.
Somehow, girls in the lower classes seem far
more natural, warmer hearted. I wonder if
it is the fear of seeming improper that makes
Margaret so cold in her manner. If it were
not for that, she would be perfect—simply
perfect.’</p>

<p>And a series of dreams began, which lasted
till the dreamer reached Euston Square.</p>

<p>Meantime Sophy, after fighting a successful
battle with a rising flood of tears, set herself
to begin, as patiently as she could, those
important trifles which formed the occupation
of her life.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> hay-harvest was over, and the corn-harvest
had not begun, so there was a comparatively
‘slack time’ at the farm. In a
month, or less, every man and woman about
the place, with probably two or three stray
Irish labourers, would be busy with the sickle,
or ‘binding,’ from early morning till late into
the twilight; but for the present there was
a period of repose.</p>

<p>Alec was sitting in the parlour with his
father and sister. He had been at home,
rather against his will, since the beginning of
May. He was now a tall, broad-shouldered
fellow, strikingly handsome in feature, but
rather awkward in limb—educated, so far as
a sufficiency of Latin, Greek, and mathematics
was concerned, but entirely ignorant of
modern languages and history, and almost as
ignorant of the world and human life as he
had been when he first went to College. His
winters had generally been spent in the society
of his friend Cameron (who had at last won
the desire of his heart, by being appointed
assistant to the Professor of Surgery), and
Cameron’s influence upon him was stronger
than he had any idea of. In heart and
in experience Alec was still a boy, and he
was, boy like, letting his attention wander
from his volume of Spinoza to dream an
impossible dream, when he was recalled to
the earth by the sound of his father’s voice.</p>

<p>‘I met Mr. Dickson to-day, Alec.’</p>

<p>‘Yes?’</p>

<p>‘He tells me the Presbytery meets next
week. Hadn’t you better be getting ready
for the examination? I suppose there is one
before you go to the Hall?’</p>

<p>Alec was silent for a moment. He understood
perfectly that the subject had been
introduced in a half-indirect way, so as to
throw upon him the burden of beginning the
attack, as it were; and he understood, too,
that the time had come for this question being
settled.</p>

<p>‘I thought I had told you, father, that I
am not going to the Free Church Hall.’</p>

<p>‘Margaret, will you leave us alone for a
few minutes?’ said Mr. Lindsay, and his
daughter gathered up her work and left the
room.</p>

<p>‘So you have been deceiving us all this
time?’ said the laird in a low tone, fixing his
cold, stern eyes upon his son.</p>

<p>‘I have never deceived you!’ burst out the
young man hotly.</p>

<p>‘When I agreed to furnish the means for
your going to College,’ said the laird slowly,
‘I certainly understood that you were thinking
of the ministry. What other reason was
there for your staying here in idleness since
you left College? And why, in that case, did
you go to College at all? You have no wish
to be a doctor, have you? Answer me, sir!’</p>

<p>‘No; I have not.’</p>

<p>‘Then you <em>have</em> been deceiving me, I see.’</p>

<p>With a great effort Alec restrained himself.</p>

<p>‘When I first went to Glasgow,’ he began,
‘I said I wanted to be educated. I said
nothing of becoming a minister; and I have
never given you any reason to suppose that I
intended doing anything of the kind.’</p>

<p>‘You knew very well, sir, that it was not
only my expectation, but my earnest desire,
and that I never would have consented to
throw away so much money on your education,
merely to try to turn you into a fine
gentleman.’</p>

<p>Alec flushed up, opened his lips, and closed
them again without speaking. He could not
tell his father that the insinuation conveyed
by his words was untrue.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Alec!’ pursued the old man, in a
softer tone, ‘think what an opportunity you
are throwing away! An opportunity that will
never come again. What life could be higher
or nobler than that spent in saving souls?’
To this Alec made no reply. ‘What are all
the honours and wealth of the world compared
to being the instrument of saving one
soul?’ asked Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>‘But I have no call to the ministry,’ said
Alec at length.</p>

<p>‘Have you sought for a call, my boy?’
asked his father. ‘Calls are not vouchsafed
to those who do not listen for the summoning
voice. Have you sought the guidance of
God in this matter? Pray, my son, pray
that you may be led aright. And now, tell
Margaret and the servants to come to
worship.’</p>

<p>Alec knew that his father meant to be kind—if
only he would submit. He knew that
the last words which the laird had spoken to
him were sincere, but they grated upon him
more unpleasantly than even the unjust and
harsh things which his father had said at the
beginning of the conversation. He resented
this interference in the affairs of his own
heart. He could see no rule or method of
distinguishing between a Divine call and a
suggestion of his own inclination. He was,
in fact, out of harmony with the religious
system in which he had been brought up.
Sometimes he was willing to believe that the
fault was entirely in himself; at other times
he felt that the whole system was cold, hard,
unlovely, and never free from a strong
tendency to cant; but he was quite at a loss
to know what he would have put in its
place.</p>

<p>That evening Margaret contrived to see her
brother alone before she went to bed. She
came up to him in silence, took his hand in
one of hers, and rested her other arm upon
his shoulder.</p>

<p>‘Alec,’ she said, ‘have you quite set your
heart against being a minister?’</p>

<p>‘That’s not a fair way to put it, Maggie,’
said he. ‘Unless one’s heart is naturally
bent upon that calling, I don’t think one
should follow it.’</p>

<p>‘But think of the good you might do!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that is such stuff, Maggie! Look at
the ministers about here: what particular
good do they do—Mr. Johnstone, or Mr.
Fergus, or Mr. Simpson, or any of them?
On Saturdays they write (or don’t write) their
sermons. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
Thursdays, and Fridays they read, or
potter about their gardens, or gossip with the
neighbours.’</p>

<p>‘They visit the sick,’ put in Margaret.</p>

<p>‘One afternoon a week is enough for
that.’</p>

<p>‘And they visit all their people regularly.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; and some of them simply pay calls,
and the zealous ones give away tracts and
ask how your soul is. A piece of impertinence!’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Alec, you are sadly changed,’ said
Margaret, withdrawing her arm from her
brother’s shoulder.</p>

<p>‘At any rate, I admit I am not fit to be a
minister.’</p>

<p>‘It will grieve father very much. He has
set his heart upon it.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t help that. I can’t do a thing like
that—live a lie my whole life through—to
please him.’</p>

<p>Margaret kissed her brother’s cheek and
left him. She had a feeling that he and she
were far apart in religious matters, and she
was right in her belief. Alec Lindsay had
read modern philosophy; he had been taught
at College that ‘free-thought’ was a man’s
inalienable inheritance, and that it was a
species of intellectual suicide to stifle a doubt.
In the Calvinism he had learned in childhood
there was plenty of dogma certainly; but
then he did not like the dogma, and he saw
no particular reason for believing it. He
was, in fact, a Theist; but he gave his father
no hint that his religious opinions had undergone
a change. He knew very well that if
he had so much as expressed a doubt as to
the soundness of the Calvinist doctrine of
Predestination, or the lawfulness of taking a
walk or reading a novel on a Sunday, his
father would have been shocked beyond
expression, and would first have stormed at
him, and then mourned him as one who had
already sold himself to the Evil One.</p>

<p>Nothing more passed between father and
son for some days, and then Mr. Lindsay
asked Alec point-blank whether he was going
to devote himself to ‘the ministry of the
Gospel.’</p>

<p>‘No, father; I have no inclination of that
kind, and I think that without a very strong
disposition to such a life it would be wrong to
begin it.’</p>

<p>The elder man fixed a cold look on his son,
but made no reply.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think I am right in saying so?’
asked Alec.</p>

<p>The laird continued to gaze at his son
without speaking, and Alec abruptly left the
room.</p>

<p>About a week afterwards Alec was startled
by his father saying to him one morning:</p>

<p>‘I have just had a note from your uncle
James. He is willing to take you into his
office, and give you a small salary. The
sooner you can get ready to go the better.’</p>

<p>‘But I have no taste for a business life.
I am not fitted for it, and <span class="lock">I——’</span></p>

<p>‘Perhaps you will tell me what you <em>are</em>
fit for,’ cried the old laird. ‘Just understand
this. If you choose to reject this offer, I
shall have no more to say to you. You may
take your own way, and I wash my hands
of you. It seems to me you are bent on
throwing away your chances.’</p>

<p>‘Surely, sir, it is better to follow one’s own
inclination in choosing a profession?’</p>

<p>‘And what may be your inclination?’</p>

<p>‘I should like to be a lawyer.’</p>

<p>‘And who is to support you while you are
studying law?’</p>

<p>‘Others have begun as poor as I, and
have risen to the top of the tree.’</p>

<p>‘It is madness—sheer madness!’ exclaimed
the laird, rising and pacing up and
down the room.</p>

<p>‘I can begin as clerk in an office,’ said
Alec.</p>

<p>‘You shall do nothing of the kind!’
shouted his father. ‘You would know, if
you knew anything at all about it, that
you would not be paid while your articles
were running. Perhaps you would like to be
an advocate?’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Alec was silent; for he knew that if he confessed
that his real wish was to go to the bar,
he would only the more effectually rouse his
father’s anger.</p>

<p>‘Give me a week to think it over,’ he
said at length. ‘It is not fair to ask me
to decide a question that will influence
the whole course of my life at a moment’s
notice.’</p>

<p>To this his father made no reply; and Alec
left the house, and wandered off to his old
quarters at the ruined castle to hold counsel
with himself.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour’s thinking he had resolved
to reject his uncle’s offer. He saw
quite plainly that if he accepted it he would be
bound down for life to the narrow life of a
Glasgow merchant—if, indeed, he had the
chance of ever becoming more than an underling.
He must give up the life of a student,
for he knew that was practically incompatible
with ‘getting on in business.’ And he must
say good-bye to his ambitions. Rather than
become a money-getting machine like one of
the men he had met at his uncle’s table, he
would go back to teaching. Then, at least,
he could keep up his reading, and continue to
attend classes at College.</p>

<p>It was, no doubt, a foolish decision to make.
But Alec could not help thinking that he could
do better with himself than spend the next few
years of his life as a clerk in his uncle’s oil-works.
He was determined to try to climb
the ladder of Fortune, even if he should be
thrown down and crushed under the feet of
the crowd.</p>

<p>‘After all,’ he said to himself, as he rose
from his seat and slowly made his way back
to the farm—‘after all, my life is my own.
I can but try. I would rather make a
struggle to rise, and fail, than not make the
attempt. But I don’t mean to fail. The
question is, how can I get my foot on the
first rung of the ladder? I haven’t five pounds
in the world.’</p>

<p>That was the difficulty; but next day a
light was thrown on his path, and that from a
quarter from which he had never expected it
to come.</p>

<p>In the afternoon his cousin Semple turned
up at the farm. This young man did not at
all like the idea of his clever cousin coming to
the oil-works. At present he was the only
relative of Mr. James Lindsay in the place;
and he thought it tolerably certain that at the
old man’s death the concern would pass into
his hands. If another nephew were introduced,
his own prospects might be seriously
injured; and so he had thought it worth while
to run down to the farm, and see whether he
could not secretly dissuade Alec from taking
this step.</p>

<p>Of course he said nothing about the matter
in the presence of Mr. Lindsay or Margaret;
and he could not help fancying that the keen
eyes of the old laird were watching him as if
to divine his intention. But when tea was
over, the two young men strolled out together,
and Semple began at once:</p>

<p>‘So you are coming to us next week, I
hear, Alec.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know that?’ said the other,
with inbred Scotch caution.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Uncle James told me to expect you.
Of course you know you’ll have to begin at
the beginning, and I fear you won’t find it
very much to your taste after your College
life.’</p>

<p>‘I may as well tell you, Semple, I’ve made
up my mind not to go. But I’m “between
the deil and the deep sea.” I don’t know
what else I am to do.’</p>

<p>‘What would you like to do?’ asked
Semple.</p>

<p>Secretly he was overjoyed at hearing of this
resolution, and he determined to further it by
every means in his power.</p>

<p>‘What I would like to do would be to go
to London, and enter the office of a good firm
of solicitors. Between ourselves, Semple, I
mean to go to the bar; but I can’t begin to
study in the regular way, because I’ve no
money. I have heard that it’s not a bad plan
to go into a solicitor’s office for awhile, to
begin with, to learn the practice. But I know
no one in London—no one in the profession,
at least.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I could help you there, Alec,’
said the other, after a pause.</p>

<p>‘I wish you could,’ said Alec earnestly.</p>

<p>‘Do you remember a fellow called Beattie?
I think he was at College while you were
there.’</p>

<p>‘We didn’t go to the same classes. He was
two or three years in advance of me; but I
remember his name very well. A clever
fellow, wasn’t he?’</p>

<p>‘Plenty of brains, certainly,’ answered
Semple. ‘Well, he had very much the
same ideas as yourself. He went to London,
and got into the office of a firm of solicitors—Hatchett,
Small, and Hatchett; and now
he is one of their managing clerks, though I
believe he has never got his articles. Well,
we are clients of Hatchetts’. They are carrying
on a big lawsuit for us just now, and I
dare say it will be a thousand pounds in their
pocket. I should think they would oblige me
in a thing of that sort; and Beattie, I know,
will do what he can for you.’</p>

<p>‘But the difficulty is, they wouldn’t pay me
any salary.’</p>

<p>‘I should think they would give you something.
You would very soon be of use to
them. They paid Beattie, I know, almost
from the first. But why don’t you go straight
to Uncle James, and ask him to give you
something to start you in life?’</p>

<p>Alec shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I’ll see if I can’t manage that for you.
He’s a regular old screw. Five hundred
pounds would be nothing to him.’</p>

<p>‘It would make a considerable difference to
me,’ said Alec, with a laugh. ‘You know,
Semple, it’s awfully good of you to trouble
yourself about my affairs.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no; not at all.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is. It’s exceedingly kind of you.
I shall never forget it as long as I live.’</p>

<p>Semple was rather amused than embarrassed
by his cousin’s expressions of gratitude.</p>

<p>‘If he had tried his best, he couldn’t have
suited my book better,’ said he to himself.
‘But I must see what I can do with the old
man.’</p>

<p>On reflection, however, he considered that
it would be dangerous for him to approach Mr.
James Lindsay himself. The shrewd old
gentleman would be sure, he thought, to see
through his motives. On his return to Glasgow,
therefore, he betook himself to Miss
Lindsay, and after telling her that Alec could
not, and would not, go into ‘the works,’ he
informed her of the plan that was on foot, and
wound up by saying that Alec was such a
clever fellow that it was a shame he should
miss his chances for the sake of a little money.
Surely his uncle would not grudge to do that
much for him.</p>

<p>‘It strikes me,’ said the old lady, ‘that
the lad’s best chance of making his fortune is
to go into his uncle’s office.’</p>

<p>She threw a keen glance at her visitor as
she spoke, but Semple bore it unmoved.</p>

<p>‘I dare say; indeed, I told him so, if I
remember right. But he has made up his
mind not to go.’</p>

<p>‘Weel, if he gets the offer of the situation
you speak o’, I’ll e’en do my best wi’ Mr.
Lindsay; but it winna be muckle, I doot.’</p>

<p>On this Semple took his leave, and that
night he went up to London, ostensibly on the
affairs of the lawsuit. Beattie and he were
old friends, and with his help he managed to
convey to Mr. Hatchett the impression that
Mr. James Lindsay would be grievously
offended if they did not oblige him by
taking his nephew into their office. It
was all settled in half an hour; and next
morning Semple was back in Glasgow.</p>

<p>All Miss Lindsay’s eloquence, however,
failed to make a deep impression on Uncle
James. He would give the lad a hundred
pounds, and that was all.</p>

<p>‘The laddie’s a fool,’ said he, ‘a clever
fool; and that’s aye the worst kind. If
I were to give him mair, it wad a’ come
to the same thing in the end.’</p>

<p>Alec’s father happened to be from home
when the welcome letter arrived to tell him
that the opening he had longed for had been
found, and that the money difficulty had been
removed. ‘Don’t say too much in thanking
your uncle,’ wrote Semple. ‘There is
nothing he hates like a fuss being made over
his presents; and, after all, there is no doubt
you have a kind of claim upon him.’</p>

<p>This, however, was not the way in which
Alec looked at the matter. Of course he
went at once to see his uncle, and thank him,
and his gratitude was so heartfelt that the
old man was touched a little.</p>

<p>‘Say nae mair, Alec; say nae mair,’ said
he. ‘I hope you’ll do well, and do us credit;
and if there should be a positive necessity for
it, I dare say another hunder might be forthcoming.’</p>

<p>‘I trust it will not be necessary, uncle.’</p>

<p>‘Weel, mony a man has won to the top o’
the tree wi’ less than a hunder pound in his
pouch at the start. Guid-day!’</p>

<p>The difficulty which had seemed so insurmountable
had disappeared; and to Alec it
seemed as if the world lay at his feet. True,
the parting with his father would be a painful
one; but that could not be helped. He
would do his best to soften the old man’s
resentment at this second frustration of his
wishes—and perhaps, he thought, some day
his father would be glad that he had taken
his own way, and determined to carve out his
fortune with his own hand.</p>

<h4>‘BUT YOU ARE NOT A CHRISTIAN.’<br>
</h4>
</div><!--end chapter head-->


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Lindsay</span> listened in silence while his son
detailed to him the plans he had made for his
future; and when Alec came to an end, he
made no remark.</p>

<p>‘I hope, father, you do not disapprove of
what I have done,’ said Alec, after waiting
for his father to speak.</p>

<p>‘You are not acting in accordance with my
wishes, as you know very well,’ was the
reply. ‘I do not forbid your going to
London, because you would pay no attention
to me if I did. But I do not approve of
your going. You will have no properly
defined position in this firm of lawyers, of
whom, after all, you know next to nothing.
You are throwing away an excellent opportunity
for a vague chance, out of mere
caprice; and you may live to regret that you
have not taken my advice. I wish you would
go over to Muirburn to-morrow, and tell
Symes that I must have the new cart-wheels
at once.’</p>

<p>Nor did Alec get much more sympathy
from his sister; though, unknown to him, she
often dropped a tear over the articles of his
outfit which she was busily preparing.</p>

<p>‘You have never wished me good luck,
Maggie,’ he said on one occasion.</p>

<p>‘You know I don’t think you are doing
right,’ she answered without looking up.</p>

<p>‘I am doing nothing wrong in choosing
my own path in life,’ cried Alec. ‘And I
must say,’ he added, provoked at her want of
sympathy, ‘you and my father are not——’
Then he stopped. ‘But I’m not going to
quarrel with you, this last week, Maggie.’</p>

<p>‘I know quite well what you were going to
say, Alec. But I am very sorry you are
going away at all, and the more so that you
are going without my father’s consent.’</p>

<p>Alec sighed impatiently.</p>

<p>‘What <em>is</em> the use of going back to all that
now?’ said he.</p>

<p>And his sister made no reply.</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined that it was a
relief to Alec, and indeed to the whole family,
when Hubert Blake made his appearance at
the farm.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said, passing his arm through
Alec’s as they strolled together towards the
river, ‘so you have settled the great question
without me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry I am too late to be of any use;
but I came off as soon as I read your letter—that
is, the very next morning. I think I
had better go back to-morrow, for my uncle
was not particularly well pleased at my running
away directly after I got home.’</p>

<p>‘I think it was more than good of you to
come,’ answered the other; ‘but now you are
here, I do wish you could stay till I go, if
you can. You see, things are not altogether
smooth here, <span class="lock">and——’</span></p>

<p>‘All right. I will stay, and we can go up
to London together. But what put it into
your head to go into a lawyer’s office?’</p>

<p>‘I want to go to the bar, and this is the
first step.’</p>

<p>‘But why?’</p>

<p>‘Because that is the great avenue by which
men rise to political power. Three-fourths of
the men in the House of Commons (that is, of
the respectable men), who have not had the
advantages of birth or fortune, have entered
by that door.’</p>

<p>Blake stared at his companion.</p>

<p>‘I had no idea you were so ambitious,’ he
said. ‘But I doubt whether, even if you did
get into the House, you would be much
nearer your goal than you are now. And you
have no idea of the difficulty of getting a
practice at the bar, unless you have a connection
among solicitors, or unless you are a
born advocate.’</p>

<p>‘Of course there will be plenty of difficulties.
I’ve made up my mind to that. But
I can see you think I ought to have taken my
uncle’s offer.’</p>

<p>‘It might have been more prudent. If
your ambition is to get into Parliament, you
might have done that, perhaps, more easily as
a wealthy manufacturer than as a struggling
barrister. And yet, I don’t know. Every
man to his taste. It is a great thing to choose
one’s own work. You will have a wider and
more varied life in London certainly, and——there’s
somebody running after us.’</p>

<p>‘It’s Cameron!’ cried Alec, as he turned
round, and ran to meet his friend. ‘This is
awfully good of you, old fellow! coming to bid
me good-bye,’ he exclaimed, as he grasped his
former chum by the hand.</p>

<p>‘I heard you were going to the land of the
southron, so I thought I would give the poor
folk at the infirmary a holiday, and come to
give you my blessing ere you departed,’
answered the Highlander.</p>

<p>Alec introduced Blake to his old companion,
and the three continued to stroll on in
company.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think,’ said Cameron, addressing
Blake, ‘our friend here was greatly left to
himself, when he decided not to help to
illuminate the world by means of paraffin oil,
and to woo the jade Fortune in your country
instead?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe you think he was wrong,’
answered Blake, with a smile. ‘You Scotchmen
look upon England as your natural prey.’</p>

<p>‘It’s not everyone that goes to fish that
comes back wi’ a full creel,’ responded
Cameron; ‘but we’ll hope that Lindsay will
spoil the Egyptians of much fine gold, and
rise to be Lord Chancellor. Last summer I
took a run down to Manchester, and as the
assizes were going on, I looked in at the
courts. It was a fearfu’ sight.’</p>

<p>‘Was it a murder case?’ asked Blake.</p>

<p>‘No; I mean the scores o’ young an’
middle-aged men daunderin’ about in wigs and
gowns, with their hands in their pockets. I
suppose every one of them thought he had a
prospect of being Lord Chancellor. One of
them was a man I had met at College—you
may remember him, Alec; Ferguson is his
name. He asked me to dine at their mess,
and after dinner they sang a song about that.
I mind the chorus. It went something like
this,’ and Cameron sang in a deep bass voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Then drink, brothers, drink,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And let every brother drink,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who has ever held a soup<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> prosecution;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For it’s possible he may</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Be Lord Chancellor some day—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he’s only got a sound constitution.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Tell us where you have been, Blake,
since I saw you last,’ said Alec, anxious to
turn the conversation from himself and his
own prospects.</p>

<p>‘Oh, the usual round—Switzerland, Rome,
and Venice. I spent a good while in
Venice.’</p>

<p>Cameron looked at the Englishman with
admiration and envy.</p>

<p>‘I would like fine to see Rome,’ he said to
himself in an undertone. Then he began to
ask questions about those cities, which Blake
answered as well as he was able.</p>

<p>After a time the conversation changed
again, for Alec began to talk to Cameron
about their old College friends, and Blake
walked on in silence. He was comparing, in
his own mind, his lot in life with that of the
two young men beside him. His advantages
had been so much greater than theirs, and his
performances had been so trifling! He had
seen, and admired, and copied: they had
struggled and acted. He was already feeling
wearied of life, while Cameron was beginning
what promised to be a successful career of
great usefulness, and Alec was bravely setting
out to battle with the world. Would he never
be able to give anything to his fellow-men in
return for the food he ate—never be able to
do anything on which he could afterwards
look back with satisfaction?</p>

<p>Alec interrupted these reflections by hinting
that they had better return to the farm, as it
was getting late, and it would soon be time
for supper.</p>

<p>Cameron was in capital spirits, and he
managed to infect the whole party with his
genial humour. Even Mr. Lindsay thawed
visibly, and spoke to his son more kindly
than he had done since Alec had refused to
walk in the way he had chosen for him.</p>

<p>The next two days passed rapidly and
pleasantly, Cameron still remaining a guest
at the farm. Blake, meanwhile, perceived
quite clearly that time had made no change
in his sentiments towards Margaret. She
seemed to him more beautiful than ever, and
more soft and womanly than she had appeared
before. And in spite of his better judgment,
he longed to end the struggle that was going
on within him, by asking her to be his wife.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of the third day,
Alec’s last day at home; and the four young
people were sitting out of doors. Margaret
was sewing something for her brother; Alec
and Cameron were stretched on the grass,
playing a game of chess. Blake was glancing
over a newspaper, when, happening to look
up, he saw Cameron looking at Margaret’s
downcast face with such a tender, admiring
gaze, that he dropped his eyes immediately,
while a strange thrill passed through his
heart. Cameron had no idea that he had
been observed, for Alec’s eyes were fastened
on the chess-board, while Blake was sitting
in the background, apparently intent on his
newspaper.</p>

<p>‘Check!’ cried Alec; and Cameron bent
once more over the board.</p>

<p>Blake rose, and walked slowly away, across
the empty stackyard. So he was not alone
in his admiration of Margaret! Was he
content that another should woo and win her?
Passionately he told himself that he was
not content. He wandered on for some
minutes, not thinking where he was going,
and after making a circuit returned to the
farm.</p>

<p>Suddenly he came upon Margaret, sitting
on a bench which overlooked the little flower-garden.</p>

<p>He sat down beside her, and was surprised
to see that her eyes were filled with tears.
She was the first to speak.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Blake,’ she said, ‘I wish to ask a
great favour from you. I wish you to keep a
watch over my brother in London. He will
be quite among strangers; and he has seen
very little of the world. I should think he
might easily be led astray. Will you see him
when you can, and do your best to warn him
if he is in danger, to keep him from bad
companions, and to encourage him when he
is cast down, as I am sure he often will
be?’</p>

<p>Her beautiful eyes, still laden with tears,
were turned upon her companion.</p>

<p>‘I will, indeed,’ said Blake, ‘for your sake,
as well as for his own.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said Margaret simply.</p>

<p>‘But I wish,’ he continued in a low voice,
hardly conscious of what he said—‘I wish
you would give me a better right to look after
him—the right of a brother.’</p>

<p>She looked up hastily, not understanding
his meaning. His face made it plain to
her.</p>

<p>‘Dear Margaret,’ he began, gently laying
hold of her hand.</p>

<p>But she started to her feet.</p>

<p>‘No, no, Mr. Blake,’ she said, almost in a
whisper. ‘That can never be.’</p>

<p>‘Never, Margaret? Why not? Why
should you turn from me? You know me
well, and I hope, at least, you don’t dislike
me. If you can but learn to love me, how
happy you would make me!’</p>

<p>‘No,’ she answered; ‘I don’t think I
could make you happy. Your life has not
been like mine. My ways, my thoughts are
not like yours. You have tastes and habits
which—oh, it is quite impossible!’</p>

<p>‘All that goes for nothing, Margaret.
Tastes and habits are soon acquired. You
would soon learn to love the world of art,
the wider world I could lead you into;’ and
again he tried to take her hand.</p>

<p>But again she drew it away.</p>

<p>‘I know I could make you happy,’ said
Hubert.</p>

<p>‘But, Mr. Blake,’ she said in a low voice,
‘you are not a Christian.’</p>

<p>Hubert was silent. From a man he would
have resented the imputation. Yet he knew
that, in Margaret’s sense of the word, she
only spoke the truth.</p>

<p>‘Not as you are, perhaps,’ he said at
length; ‘but that need not part us. You
will make me a Christian; you will teach
me.’</p>

<p>Margaret shook her head sadly, and turned
away.</p>

<p>‘Don’t go yet,’ cried Hubert, following her.
‘Answer me one question first. Do you love
me? That is the only thing I care for.’</p>

<p>‘It is not the only thing,’ answered the
girl. ‘I would never marry a man who
was not a Christian.’</p>

<p>Hubert saw it was useless to argue.</p>

<p>‘Do you love me?’ he repeated.</p>

<p>Margaret looked up, her lovely face pale
with emotion.</p>

<p>‘No,’ she answered.</p>

<p>‘Will you not try to love me?’</p>

<p>‘No, I cannot,’ she repeated in a lower
tone.</p>

<p>‘Do, Margaret.’</p>

<p>‘No; please don’t ask me again.’</p>

<p>Her tone was firmer and clearer now, and
Hubert saw that the case was decided.</p>

<p>‘If I come again—in six months, or a
year?’</p>

<p>‘You would only distress me. I should
only tell you again what I tell you to-night.’</p>

<p>‘Is that your final answer, Margaret?’</p>

<p>‘It is—my final answer.’</p>

<p>‘Then—good-bye. I will not forget my
promise about your brother.’</p>

<p>He turned his back on the farm, and
walked away by himself, not returning until
it was time for the evening meal. He felt
the disappointment keenly, all the more
keenly that he had never anticipated a refusal.
It was cruel to think that Margaret was
sacrificing his happiness, and perhaps her
own, to what he called her fanaticism. He
was furious to think that she would never be
his, that he might entreat her to the end of
time, and she would never yield.</p>

<p>As for Margaret, she slipped into the house
and was very little seen again that evening.
No one ever knew what had passed between
her and Hubert Blake. Not even to her own
heart did Margaret answer the last question
which he had pressed upon her.</p>

<p>That night she waited long behind the
half-open door of her room, that she might
waylay her brother as he came upstairs. At
last the lights were put out, and she heard
his footstep.</p>

<p>She came up to him with a half-articulate
whisper, and threw her arms round his neck.
Then she sobbed, as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>‘Don’t, Maggie. Don’t, dear old Maggie,’
whispered her brother as he kissed her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Alec! you are going away. Perhaps
I may never see you again; and I’ve been so
cold and unkind! Oh, Alec, I don’t want to
lose you: that was the reason of it. But I
am so sorry! I would give anything—all I
have in the world—if only I had behaved
differently.’</p>

<p>‘It was my fault, Maggie, every bit as
much as yours.’</p>

<p>‘No; no; no!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it was. But never mind. What
does it matter now? I know you love me,
Maggie, and that’s all I care for.’</p>

<p>‘And you will write to me?’</p>

<p>‘Every week, Maggie.’</p>

<p>‘Whether you have anything to say or
not?’</p>

<p>‘Whether I have anything to say or not.
And I will come to see you at Christmas.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Will</em> you?’</p>

<p>‘I will, though it should only be for a
day.’</p>

<p>‘Then I shall have something to look
forward to. Oh, Alec, how good you are!’</p>

<p>And an hour passed before the brother
and sister parted.</p>

<p>Next morning the good-byes were said in
haste, but they were not so painful as Alec
had anticipated. His father’s reserve broke
down at the last; he embraced his son, and
put an envelope into his hand containing fifty
pounds in bank-notes.</p>

<p>‘Take it, lad,’ he said, as Alec would have
put it back in his hand—‘take it; I can
easily spare it. It’s hard to part with you;
and I had hoped—but never mind that now.
Fear God, Alec, and keep His commandments,
for that is the whole duty of man.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, father!’ cried Alec; ‘I almost wish—if
I had <span class="lock">known——’</span></p>

<p>‘Come, my boy; it’s time you were gone.
You will miss the coach.’</p>

<p>Another hurried embrace from Maggie,
another shake of the hand from his father,
and he was gone; and the father and
daughter went back together to the silent
and empty house.</p>

</h3>
<h4>IN LONDON.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Who</span> has not tried to put into words his first
impressions of London? And who has not
failed? Probably, if people were quite careful
not to impose upon themselves, they
would feel bound to confess that, after the first
feeling of bewilderment was over, their chief
impression was one of a vague disappointment.
They knew that they had set foot in
the Metropolis of the Empire, and they could
not help forgetting that London is not to be
seen in half an hour.</p>

<p>This, at least, was Alec Lindsay’s experience.
When he emerged from the railway-station
and found himself in the Euston Road,
he could hardly believe that he had at last
reached the city of his dreams. With his
overcoat over his arm and his bag in his hand
(avoiding, like a thrifty Scot, the needless
expense of a cab), he trudged slowly eastwards,
taking mental notes as he went. He
was surprised at the comparative stillness
around him. He had often heard of the
bustle in the streets of London; but the
Euston Road was quieter than many a street
in Glasgow. Then the houses offended him.
They were much lower in height than those to
which he had been accustomed, and much
uglier. He gazed with contempt on the
tumble-down buildings of wood, or of brick
not much more durable than wood, projected
from the houses to the pavement. He was
surprised at the absence of hurry, at the
street children playing about (as much wrapped
up in their play as if they had been on a
village-green), at the half-intelligible Cockney
dialect.</p>

<p>After reaching King’s Cross Alec made his
way to a small street lying to the north of
Gray’s Inn, where there was a private
boarding-house, and there he established himself
till he should find suitable lodgings. As
soon as he had had a cup of tea he sallied out
again into the streets; for the roar of London
was in his ears, and he could not keep still.</p>

<p>‘I wish Cameron were going to hunt for
diggings with me,’ he said to himself, as his
mind flew back to the time when his friend
had compelled Mrs. Macpherson to admit him
to her house.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the sense of loneliness
descended upon him, almost like a tangible
thing. He was standing at the crossing, close
to the Metropolitan Railway Station, where
the crowd was thickest. Half mechanically
he noted one and another come and go, and
vanish in the crowd, like autumn leaves on a
swollen river. They came and went, and he
was alone. In this great swarm of human
creatures none knew his face, not one knew
even his name.</p>

<p>The air was thick and tainted, heavy with
a thousand offensive odours; and the yellow
sunshine from the sinking sun seemed to be
struggling in vain to teach the dwellers in this
unlovely city something of the peace and
beauty in the great world beyond. And Alec,
looking up, saw its radiance. He saw the
rose-colour in the air. He saw a few unconsidered
dirty panes of glass, high up in the
gable of a warehouse, flashing like gems on
the wall of the city that hath no need of the
sun—and he remembered that the same sunlight
was lighting up the wide moors and the
bare slopes of Ben Ime, and playing on the
green seaweed and the gray rocks, where
none but angel-eyes were looking on.</p>

<p>Afterwards Alec came to know London well,
for he was never tired of wandering about the
streets. He came to know that Cheapside
and the Strand were not ‘London,’ nor even
Westminster or Piccadilly. He lost himself,
over and over again, in labyrinths of small,
grimy streets, each twenty feet of which made
a separate home. He found that in the East
End there were miles and miles of land
covered with manufactories, warehouses, and
houses of repulsive ugliness filled with hardworking
people. He came to the conclusion
at last that the one thing in which London
was unique was its unsearchableness. In
other towns there were half a dozen, perhaps
a dozen, important thoroughfares; here they
were numberless. And no sooner had he
studied one neighbourhood till he knew it
very well, than he found another inhabited by
people who had totally different habits and
modes of life, different interests; speaking,
perhaps, a different language.</p>

<p>On the morning after his arrival Alec presented
himself at the office of Messrs. Hatchett,
Small, and Hatchett, in Theobald’s Road.
He was shown into a large, well-furnished,
but not very clean room, lined with calf-covered
volumes, which were kept more for
show than for use. Here, early as it was, the
senior partner was seated, busy over his
correspondence. He looked up as Alec
entered, showing a face which expressed less
than any human countenance which Alec had
ever beheld. It was the face of a man who
had trained himself to say the correct thing,
and not a word more—who had schooled himself
for thirty years to allow nothing of such
feelings or sentiments as he might possess to
appear in his face. His hair was well brushed;
his coat fitted perfectly; his boots were all
that boots could be; his tie was of exactly
the proper hue, neither sombre nor brilliant;
his manner—to those whom he considered his
equals—was unexceptionable.</p>

<p>‘So you are Mr. Lindsay—eh? Glad to
see you. Take a seat. A connection of a
client of ours in Scotland, I believe. A
nephew? Yes—just <span class="lock">so——’</span></p>

<p>(Dictating to a clerk at his side:)</p>

<p>‘Butler and Smith, solicitors. Dear Sirs,—We
beg to acknowledge your letter of yesterday’s
date. Your offer of £300 and costs is
quite inadequate. We have briefed Mr. Bussel,
and the case will come on for hearing, we
expect, in three days’ time. Yours, etc.——Major-General
Potts. Dear Sir,—Yourself <i>v.</i>
Brown. The defendant has offered £300 and
costs, which is more than we expected, and
we advise you to accept it. The costs, of
course, are very heavy; and in the event of
an adverse verdict they would fall entirely
upon you. We are, dear sir, yours faithfully.——By
the way, Mr. Tibbets, see that
that brief in Brown and Potts’ case goes over
to Mr. Bussel this forenoon.—And now, Mr.
Lindsay, what can I do for you? You want
to see a little of our business, try what it is
like before taking articles, I believe?’</p>

<p>As he spoke, Mr. Hatchett opened another
envelope, glanced over its contents, and placed
them on a little heap of papers at one side of
the table.</p>

<p>‘I am not sure yet that I shall take
articles,’ said Alec. ‘It is very probable I
may not do so.’</p>

<p>‘We never take pupils,’ said Mr. Hatchett,
his eyes on a fresh letter as he spoke. ‘It is
our invariable rule. But we have no objection
to your being here a few months, to oblige
Mr. <span class="lock">Lindsay—</span>none at all.’</p>

<p>Then he seemed to forget all about the new
clerk and his affairs, and remained plunged in
thought for some seconds. Finally, he laid
aside the letter without speaking, and went on
to open another.</p>

<p>Before him was a pile of letters which had
yet to be got through; and on one side lay a
bundle of deeds and documents which had just
come up from the law-stationer. At his right
hand stood two baskets, one being a deep one
for the envelopes and waste paper, the other a
shallow one for the letters themselves. On a
table was a tray for the documents which came
by the post.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Hatchett had finished his correspondence
the door opened, and a tall, thin
young man, with a pale face, black hair, large
features, and a keen, shrewd expression of
countenance, came into the room.</p>

<p>‘Ah! Mr. Beattie—a little late, eh?’—and
the lawyer began to discuss with his manager
in a low tone the details of the business before
them. It was not until that was over that
Alec’s existence was remembered. Then his
fellow-countryman came up with a smile and
shook hands with him.</p>

<p>‘Yes; I think you had better take charge
of Mr. Lindsay for the present,’ said Mr.
Hatchett. ‘I dare say you will be able to
make him useful. And as to that mortgage
of the Waste Paper Utilization Company, you
had better write at once and refuse their offer.
That’s all, I think.’</p>

<p>Alec followed his new acquaintance up two
flights of stairs into a small room crowded
with tables, every one of which was covered
with bundles of papers.</p>

<p>‘This is my den,’ said Beattie, ‘but I
thought you would like a room to yourself, so
I told them to clear out a little place for you
across the passage;’ and he led the way to
another room on the same floor.</p>


<p>It was small, dusty, and, what was even
worse, dark, as a tall building opposite the
only window obscured the light. There was
no carpet on the floor. In one corner stood
an old bookcase with cupboards underneath
for papers; and in another there was a
dilapidated fireplace.</p>

<p>‘Sorry to put you into such a poor place,
but perhaps we’ll be able to get you a better
room by-and-by,’ said Beattie with a smile;
and Alec assured him that he wanted nothing
better.</p>

<p>‘What sort of work would you like to
begin with?’ asked the managing clerk, with
another smile. ‘Conveyancing? or common
law? or chancery practice?’</p>

<p>‘Really, I don’t know. Whatever department
I can be of most use in. I shall have
to learn something of all of them, I suppose.’</p>

<p>‘Conveyancing is my own branch,’ said
Beattie. ‘Suppose you begin with that.’</p>

<p>He left the room, and soon returned with
an armful of deeds and papers.</p>

<p>‘This,’ he said, touching a blue paper, ‘is
an abstract of that deed. Compare it with
the deed, and you will see how it is done.
Then copy it on these large sheets. Here is
one you may use as a model. And then you
may try to draw an abstract of this deed,’ and
he touched another one as he spoke, ‘in exactly
the same way. If you are not sure of anything,
come and ask me;’ and, with another
smile, Mr. Beattie left the room.</p>

<p>Alec could not help admiring the clearness
and precision with which the directions were
given. He found the work interesting from
its novelty, and by no means difficult.</p>

<p>He had been busy for an hour or two,
when the door slowly opened, and a shabbily-dressed
little man with red hair sidled into the
room, and, hardly looking at its occupant,
began to hunt for a volume among the bookshelves.</p>

<p>Alec merely glanced up, and bent again
over his work. When he looked up a second
time, the little man was standing with a book
in his hand, pretending to consult it, but evidently
using it as a pretext for taking stock of
the new clerk.</p>

<p>‘Good-morning,’ said Alec.</p>

<p>‘Guid-day to ye, Mr. Lindsay,’ replied the
other, extending a not very clean hand across
the table. ‘I’m glad tae see ye. It’s a
pleasure to see ony ane frae the auld
country.’</p>

<p>‘You’re in the office, I suppose,’ said
Alec.</p>

<p>The other nodded, put his hands in his
trousers-pockets, and stared at Alec from the
other side of the table.</p>

<p>His appearance was certainly not prepossessing.
His hair was long and untidy,
his eyes bloodshot and shifty; and his chin
was covered with an ill-shaved beard. He
was evidently not a young man, but he had
the manners of an ill-bred boy. His expression
was a mixture of shrewdness, meanness,
and presumption. Alec wanted to get rid of
him, but he hardly knew how to do it.</p>

<p>‘You’re from Glasgow?’ said the red-haired
man.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘And I’m from the Mearns. That’s no far
from Glasgow. I used to ken the place weel.
My name’s MacGowan. Ye’ve maybe heard
o’ my uncle, Dr. MacGowan of Strathbogie?’</p>

<p>‘Not that I remember;’ and Alec turned
again to his papers.</p>

<p>But the other took no notice of that.</p>

<p>‘An’ to think that you were in Glasgow but
yesterday!’ exclaimed MacGowan.</p>

<p>‘Is it long since you came to London?’
asked Alec, by way of being civil.</p>

<p>‘Fifteen years; fifteen weary years, come
Martinmas,’ answered MacGowan with an
emphatic nod. ‘And, though I ken mair o’
what they ca’ law—though it’s a poor thing
compared wi’ Scottish Jurisprudence—than
either Mr. Hatchett, Mr. Small, or Mr.
Beattie—and that’s no sayin’ muckle—I’m
just where I was fifteen years ago, a clerk, wi’
thirty-five shillin’s a week.’</p>

<p>Alec murmured something by way of sympathy,
and the other went on:</p>

<p>‘Paid monthly, Mr. Lindsay, paid monthly.
And it’s sometimes very inconvenient to wait
till the first o’ the month for the sma’
monthly steepend.’</p>

<p>Alec murmured something still more indistinct.</p>

<p>‘And the cashier here has a heart like the
nether mill-stone. Precious little o’ the milk
o’ human kindness in <em>his</em> carcass. He’d see
ye driven oot to dee on the street—he’d see a
man wantin’ his denner, before he’d advance
him a poor five shillings on his next month’s
screw. An’ that minds me, Mr. Lindsay.
Next Wednesday is the first o’ the month.
If you could lend me a sma’ sum till that
time—say five shillings.—Thank ye, sir. I
look upon you as a true Scotchman, who will
not see a brother Scot in extremities without
extending the helping hand.’</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and had barely time
to pocket the coins when the door opened,
and Beattie came into the room. At the
sight of his cold, impassive face, MacGowan
shrank back, and turned in confusion to the
bookcase. Beattie fixed him with his eye;
and MacGowan, not daring to meet it, slipped
past his superior into the passage.</p>

<p>‘An idle, drunken, good-for-nothing vagabond,’
said Beattie, as soon as he had disappeared.
‘I advise you not to speak to him.
He will take all sorts of liberties with you
if you allow him.’</p>

<p>Then he looked over the abstracts, explained
one or two points, and ended by
asking Alec to dine with him that evening
at the Holborn Restaurant.</p>

<p>Of course Alec accepted the invitation;
but he did so without any feeling of pleasure.
Beattie had been civil, and even friendly; but
somehow Alec could not bring himself to like
him. He smiled too often, and his smile was
a purely conventional one, from the teeth
outwards, fading away in a moment and
leaving his face as stern and cold as before.
His features were harsh, and his long upper
lip gave an unpleasant look to his face.
But most of all Alec disliked his accent. It
smacked strongly of affectation. The Scotch
intonation was still there and refused to be
effaced, while the English manner of speaking
had evidently been laboriously grafted upon
the original stock. The result was not
satisfactory to anyone but Mr. Beattie himself.</p>

<p>Soon after Alec and his host had taken
their seats at table that evening, Mr. Beattie
elicited the fact that Mr. James Semple was
virtually at the head of his uncle’s oil-works,
and that in all probability he would be the
old man’s heir; and from that moment Alec
became a very secondary person in his eyes.
The two had not much in common, and the
conversation languished till it seemed at one
point as if it would die out altogether. As
the evening proceeded, however, and the wine
in the bottles diminished, matters improved;
and by the time the two young men had lit
their cigars, Beattie was giving his views on
the state of society and the general scheme
of things with considerable freedom.</p>

<p>‘There’s no place in the world,’ said he,
with much emphasis, ‘where there’s so many
beggars on horseback, as there are in and
about this city of London. Go out on the
streets, or go to any of the fashionable
suburbs, and see the kind of people who roll
past in their carriages. If you were to take
the master out, put on his coachman’s livery,
and set him on the box, put his overcoat and
hat on the coachman and get <em>him</em> inside, no
one would notice the difference.’</p>

<p>‘But there is the aristocracy.’</p>

<p>‘True; but it is the rich parvenus, the
nobodies, that make London. And, after all,
I fancy a long purse and a lavish hand will
win a man’s way into any house in this
country. Look at Baron Brand, as he calls
himself! I remember when that man came
to our office ready to do any dirty work we
liked to put him to. And see where he is now.’</p>

<p>‘But there are surely circles of men of
letters, of artists,’ began Alec.</p>

<p>‘No doubt; but who knows or cares anything
about them? They might be swept off
the face of the earth to-morrow, and London
would never miss them.’</p>

<p>It occurred to Alec that the same thing
might be said of a good many other social institutions
in London, but he held his tongue.</p>

<p>‘Wealth is the great power, after all,’
resumed Beattie, ‘even in politics. Name
ten famous men in the country who are not
rich, or at least rich enough to live as wealthy
people do. You can’t.’</p>

<p>‘There’s Ruskin.’</p>

<p>‘Ruskin was rich, rich enough, at least, to
travel and spend his time as he liked, or he
never could have become famous. Years ago,
with diligence and some ability, a man could
push his way to the front. But the crowd is
too thick for that now.’</p>

<p>‘But, surely, eminence in one’s <span class="lock">profession——’</span></p>

<p>‘Ay, but how is that attained?’</p>

<p>‘By learning it thoroughly, <span class="lock">and——’</span></p>

<p>Beattie burst into a hoarse laugh.</p>

<p>‘My dear fellow, you have the simplest
notions. Never mind; you’ll know better in
time. Learning! Now, look here. Take
our own profession. That little drunken
beggar in our office, MacGowan, knows more
law than most men with wigs on their
heads I have come across—more than many
a Q.C. I dare say he told you as much
himself.’</p>

<p>‘He did,’ said Alec, with a laugh.</p>

<p>‘And he gets eighty or ninety pounds a
year. Take my own case. I know as much,
and am as good a man of business (though I
say it myself) as any of my governors. They
give me three hundred a year, while young
Hatchett has as many thousands. And what
then? His tailor has more than twice as
much as he has. I know it for a fact.’</p>

<p>‘I never thought it mattered very much
what a man has,’ said Alec serenely.</p>

<p>Beattie looked at him curiously, and went
on:</p>

<p>‘You are ambitious, then? And you think
learning, diligence, and so on, will help you
up the ladder?’</p>

<p>‘That’s what I mean to try,’ said Alec
with a laugh, and something of a blush.</p>

<p>‘It is impossible, or next to it. How
many men, able men, well-educated men, do
you think there are in London, grinding away
at law, or writing books, or painting pictures,
or designing buildings till their hair is gray?
Who ever hears of them, or thinks of them?
They will never reach even the first rung
of the ladder. Never.’</p>

<p>‘How, then, do men get on?’</p>

<p>Beattie lifted his eyebrows.</p>

<p>‘Some, a few, have exceptional gifts, and
when they do get a chance they let it be seen.
But, as a rule, those who come to the front
don’t push their way through the crowd;
they climb over other men’s heads. They
hang on to what men they do know, and
flatter or bother them into giving them the
opportunity they want. Then, when they
have got it, they make the most of it. They
never lose a chance of advertising themselves.
Better, they say, be spoken of as a cad or a
fool, than not be spoken of at all. They
never lose an opportunity of sticking a spoke
in a rival’s wheel; and they will half ruin a
man one minute, and meet him with a “Well,
old man,” the next, as if they were the
greatest friends in the world.’</p>

<p>Alec’s face wore an expression of deep
disgust.</p>

<p>‘And the beggars on horseback, having
filled their purses out of some tobacco-shop,
or grog-shop, or shoddy-shop, put their
thumbs in the arm-holes of their waistcoats,
lean back in their carriages, and think themselves
the pick of mankind, till a lord comes
their way, and then they bow down in the
dust before him—that is, if he’s richer than
they are.’</p>

<p>Alec was getting a little tired of his friend’s
cynicism, so he rose to go.</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe it,’ said he to himself, as
he made his way home. ‘There are plenty of
fellows, fellows who have got on too, who
wouldn’t do a dirty thing to save their lives.
If it is impossible—well, so be it.’</p>

<p>William Beattie was soured by disappointment.
He would not allow for the natural
advantages which those before him in the race
derived from wealth and business connections.
He hated his employers, because they showed
no disposition to ‘give him his articles,’ and
make him a member of the firm. He greatly
longed to throw up his post and try to find a
nearer road to wealth, but this he did not dare
to do. As for his sneers at ‘beggars on
horseback,’ they were simply due to envy.</p>

</h3>
<h4>AN UNCONVENTIONAL GUEST.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Hubert Blake returned to Highgate
after his hurried journey to Scotland, it was
evident to Sophy’s eyes that something had
happened to him. Before he went north he
was bright and full of spirits. Now he was
listless, moody, and unsociable. If he had
been his own master, he would not have gone
back to London at all. He would have set
off at once for another long, aimless tour.
But he felt that something was due to his
uncle, and shortly after he left the Castle
Farm, he made his appearance without warning
at Grove House.</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t you write and say you were
coming?’ asked old Mr. Blake, in his usual
peevish tone.</p>

<p>‘Really, sir, I didn’t think of it. I didn’t
suppose it mattered.’</p>

<p>‘One always likes to know when anything
is going to happen,’ said the old man, half
offended at his nephew’s want of courtesy.</p>

<p>And Hubert, totally unconscious that he
had given any offence, sauntered out into the
garden. Sophy was there, sitting on her
favourite garden-seat, and as Hubert came
forward she rose to meet him, with a smile
on her face.</p>

<p>‘Well, Sophy,’ was his greeting, as he sat
down beside her, ‘how have you been getting
on?’</p>

<p>‘Exactly as usual. And you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I? Well; I found that the matter
I went to Scotland about had got settled
without my intervention, as things have a
habit of doing if you only let them alone.
So I stayed a few days at the farm; and then
I came back. That’s all.’</p>

<p>‘You might have told us you were
coming.’</p>

<p>‘So my uncle said to me. Perhaps it
would have been more polite; but what’s the
use of making a fuss? My coming or going
isn’t a thing of so much importance.’</p>

<p>After that nothing was said for a minute or
two; and Hubert, stooping down, picked up
a few pebbles, and began jerking them with
his thumb into the laurels.</p>

<p>‘Have you come back to town for the
winter?’ asked Sophy at length.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said the other absently.</p>

<p>Sophy stole a glance at her companion.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think uncle will be able to make
up his mind to go away at all this autumn.
I think it such a pity.’</p>

<p>To this Blake made no reply; he only
went on pelting the bushes.</p>

<p>‘The Colmans called here yesterday,’ began
Sophy once more. ‘They came to tell us
that Edmund Colman has taken a first-class.’</p>

<p>‘Most awful prig!’ murmured Hubert
under his breath.</p>

<p>‘I am going to have three hundred snowdrop
bulbs set in the grass-borders in October,’
said Sophy, changing the subject. ‘Don’t
you think they will look very nice?’</p>

<p>‘I dare say.’</p>

<p>Sophy said no more; and Hubert got up
to return to the house. As he looked round
before moving away, he was struck by the
expression on Sophy’s face, as she bent over
her work, and he sat down again.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter, Sophy? Have I
offended you in any way?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Is it because I didn’t write to say I was
coming? <span class="lock">Surely——’</span></p>

<p>‘Oh no; not at all.’</p>

<p>‘There is something. Don’t let us have a
misunderstanding, for Heaven’s sake. If I
have hurt you, tell me frankly what it is.’</p>

<p>‘It is only this,’ said Sophy, gathering
courage, ‘that our old relations seem to have
changed entirely. Before you went away
you used to be interested in our little doings.
Now you don’t care at all. We don’t seem
to belong to the same family now. You tell
us nothing about yourself. You go away for
two years, <span class="lock">and——’</span></p>

<p>Sophy stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, dear me!’ Hubert groaned within
himself; but when he spoke his tone was
kind and gentle.</p>

<p>‘The fact is, Sophy, I’m spoiled for want
of something to do. It would do me all the
good in the world to be forced to earn my
bread as a day-labourer for twelve months.
But I haven’t the pluck to do it.’</p>

<p>‘You have your profession,’ said Sophy.</p>

<p>‘I’m sick of it. Everything seems so dull
and tasteless, as if nothing were really worth
anything. I’m tired of my life—tired of
myself, I suppose, that is. Do you never
feel like that?’</p>

<p>Sophy sighed inaudibly, and made no
reply.</p>

<p>‘I’ve a great mind to put twenty pounds
in my pocket, go to New York, and try to
make a living there somehow. I suppose I’d
fail: and I don’t see that it would very much
matter. Nothing does matter very much,
does it?’</p>

<p>‘Not if one lives for one’s self,’ said Sophy.</p>

<p>She feared she had said too much, but her
companion did not seem to notice it.</p>

<p>‘By the way,’ he said after a pause, ‘that
young cousin you’ve heard me speak of, Alec
Lindsay, has just come up to town. I ought
to be civil to him. He’s not a bad sort of
fellow—a little countrified, that’s all. He
gives one the feeling of there being a good
deal in him, that will come out some day.
Do you mind my asking my uncle if I may
invite him to come here and dine some
evening?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I don’t mind. I shall be very
pleased to see him.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid you won’t find him amusing.
He’s very simple and outspoken. In fact, he
is one of those fellows who don’t need to be
outspoken. His face always tells you what
he is thinking of before he opens his lips.’</p>

<p>At this point a servant came in and
intimated that Mr. Blake was tired of his
own company, and Hubert and Sophy went
into the house together.</p>

<p>Some days passed before Blake could
procure Alec’s address by means of a letter
to the farm; and then he asked his Scotch
cousin to dinner.</p>

<p>It was a new experience for Alec. Everything
at Grove House seemed daintier, more
delicate, and more precise than what he had
been accustomed to. Never in his life had
he seen so much money and trouble lavished
upon the petty details of existence; never
had he seen the art of comfortable living
carried to such perfection.</p>

<p>When the little party adjourned to the
drawing-room after dinner, this impression
was strengthened. The soft low seats, the
thick carpet—for Mr. Blake would not
tolerate stained boards and Eastern mats—the
softly shaded and tinted lights, the
delicate china, all helped to produce the
effect. The young Scotchman felt too big,
too strong and awkward, for these luxurious
surroundings.</p>

<p>Sophy could scarcely tell what to make of
her guest. She liked him; she liked his
frank, open face, and his unconventional, unaffected
manners; she liked his strong northern
speech. But she hardly knew how to talk to
him. He had no idea of the art of saying
little polite nothings for the sake of keeping
conversation going.</p>

<p>‘You have only come south lately?’ she
asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>‘Only ten days ago.’</p>

<p>‘And how do you like London?’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by London?’</p>

<p>Sophy was naturally at a loss for an answer,
and Alec went on:</p>

<p>‘London means so many things. The
houses are very mean-looking.’</p>

<p>‘But the people?’ asked Sophy, hiding her
amusement under a conventional smile. ‘How
do you like them?’</p>

<p>‘They are very smart,’ answered Alec,
speaking with great deliberation, ‘and quick
in all they do, and selfish, and always in a
hurry; and they think that London is all the
world.’</p>

<p>‘You have seen some of the sights, I
suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. I went to the National Gallery to
see the pictures. Some of them I couldn’t
make anything of. But some of them were
simply splendid. And Westminster Abbey!
I never saw anything like it!’</p>

<p>‘You admired the Abbey, then?’</p>

<p>‘It is—oh! I can’t find words to tell you
what I thought of it! It provoked me so, to
see the stupid people going about with their
faces as calm as if they were going to dinner,
or staring at one lump of a monument after
another. It seems as if it were alive, and
knew how beautiful it is. The columns seem
never tired of springing up, and up, and up, as if
they would reach to heaven; and yet they are
satisfied when they join each other in a perfect
arch. Who built it? Who imagined it?’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure I don’t know, Mr. Lindsay,’ said
Sophy, glancing to Hubert for information.
He had been watching Sophy, amused by her
wonder at the boy’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>‘It was built by the Benedictines, I believe,’
said he.</p>

<p>‘I thought nothing could be finer than
Glasgow Cathedral till I saw Westminster,’
said Alec simply.</p>

<p>‘Have you a cathedral at Glasgow? I
thought you were all Presbyterians in Scotland,’
said Sophy.</p>

<p>‘Oh, a very fine one,’ said Hubert, answering
for his cousin—‘small, but a good
specimen of its era. And the crypt is particularly
good, the finest in Britain, I believe.’
(This gratified Alec immensely.) ‘And what
did you think of St. Paul’s? You have seen
St. Paul’s, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘I liked the outside; at least, it seems very
grand. And when I first went under the
dome I felt as if I had been on the top of a
mountain.’</p>

<p>‘When you went to the top of the dome,
the stone gallery, I suppose you mean,’ said
Sophy.</p>

<p>‘No; when I went under the dome.’</p>

<p>‘I understand you,’ said Hubert. ‘It gives
you something of the same sense of space
and vastness.’</p>

<p>‘But there’s very little beauty about it,’
continued Alec. ‘It’s big, and that is about
all. It’s nothing to be compared with
Westminster.’</p>

<p>‘Will you give us some music, Sophy?’
asked Hubert, moving towards the piano.</p>

<p>Sophy could play well—she had plenty of
time for practice—and she chose one of
Beethoven’s sonatas.</p>

<p>‘Do you like that?’ she asked at the end
of the first movement, turning to Alec.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I dare say it’s very beautiful, but I don’t
understand what it means in the least. I
don’t care for it.’</p>

<p>‘Frank, at least,’ murmured Sophy to herself,
as she turned over the leaves of her
music-book. Then she began to play the
‘Moonlight Sonata,’ and at the end of the
second movement she stopped again. ‘Do
you like that any better?’ she asked.</p>

<p>Alec did not answer at once, and she rose
from her seat, a little piqued at what she
thought his rudeness. But Blake saw that he
was trying to steady his voice before replying.</p>

<p>‘Would you be so kind, if you don’t mind
the trouble,’ he said in a very low tone, ‘as to
play that piece over again, from the beginning?’</p>

<p>Sophy consented, of course, and as she
finished she asked Alec if he would care to
hear anything else.</p>

<p>‘Not just now, please; anything else would
sound coarse after that, wouldn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you are right,’ said Sophy, with
a smile.</p>

<p>‘How happy you must be, to be able to
play all that whenever you like!’ exclaimed
Alec.</p>

<p>‘Do you think so? It is a very easy
passage,’ said Sophy, again a little at a loss
how to answer her unconventional guest.</p>

<p>‘Will you give us a song now?’ asked
Hubert.</p>

<p>But unfortunately Sophy chose one or two
drawing-room songs of no musical character
whatever; and as Alec thought them very
poor, he was so much occupied in trying to
find something to say that would not be
absolutely rude, that he forgot to thank the
performer; and Sophy noticed the omission.</p>

<p>‘Well, what do you think of the young
Scotchman, Sophy?’ asked Hubert on his
return to the drawing-room, after Alec had
taken his leave.</p>

<p>Sophy raised her eyebrows, and dropped
the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>‘I hardly know,’ she replied. ‘He is very
unconventional; not commonplace certainly.
I rather like him. He has fine, expressive
eyes. But he has no manners.’</p>

<p>‘That will come in time,’ said Hubert,
stifling a yawn. ‘You can’t expect fine
manners from a farmhouse.’</p>

<p>Hubert was right. As the months went on
Alec unconsciously learned to adapt his
manners to those of the Londoners. He lost,
in part, the roughness of his Scottish speech;
and he insensibly acquired a more polished
and conventional style of address. He visited
not infrequently at Grove House, even when
Blake was no longer to be found there; and
Sophy began to take quite a strong liking for
him.</p>

<p>‘Take care, Sophy,’ said Hubert one day
laughingly, as he noticed what good friends
the two had become; ‘take care, or Alec’s
<i lang="fr">beaux yeux</i> will be too much for you.’</p>

<p>Sophy turned away; and Hubert thought
she looked hurt, he didn’t know why.</p>

<p>Alec had been at Messrs. Hatchett’s office
for some months, when one day, as he passed
through the outer office, Beattie came downstairs
with a small sheaf of papers in his
hand.</p>

<p>‘Where’s MacGowan?’ he asked sharply.</p>

<p>‘He’s not come down to-day yet, sir,’
answered one of the other clerks. ‘I believe
he’s not very well.’</p>

<p>Beattie made no reply, but his face wore
a very ugly look as he turned and left the
room.</p>

<p>‘’E’ll get the sack <em>this</em> time, and no mistake,’
Alec overheard one of the clerks say to
another, as he went out.</p>

<p>He went on to Lincoln’s Inn, and on his
way back to the office he met MacGowan
coming, apparently, away from the office,
with a very miserable expression of countenance.
He looked, indeed, a pitiable object,
even more dilapidated than usual, while his
pale face and trembling hands showed that
he had not yet recovered from the effects of
his last drinking-bout. Over his arm hung a
tattered coat, in which he had laboured at the
desk for the last six years.</p>

<p>This garment he changed to his left arm
on Alec’s approach, and held out his right
hand.</p>

<p>‘Fareweel, Maister Lindsay,’ said the poor
fellow, with an air half sad, half comical.
‘They’ve gien me the sack. That’s the
result o’ bein’ conveevial. Weel. It’s a
wide warl, an’ a chancey; but we’ll maybe
foregather<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> again some day. Ye’ve been a
guid freen’ to me, Maister Lindsay. As for
that sma’ maitter o’ the five shillin’s ye lent
me—perhaps ye’ll allow <span class="lock">me—tae——’</span></p>

<p>The sentence was artistically constructed.
It was capable of being turned into an offer
of repayment or a request that the matter
might be allowed to stand over for a time,
according as circumstances might direct; and
it was accompanied by the production of an
extremely shabby leathern purse, which evidently
was but scantily furnished.</p>

<p>‘Oh, never mind, never mind,’ said Alec
hastily. ‘Any time will do for that—when
you get rich. But has Mr. Hatchett really
turned you away?’</p>

<p>‘Aye; or raither that stuck-up deevil,
Wullie Beattie. But I’ll be even wi’ him
yet; him and his scunnersome<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> pride!’</p>

<p>‘Have you any prospect of finding another
situation?’ asked Alec.</p>

<p>The other slowly but decisively shook his
head.</p>

<p>‘What will you do, then?’</p>

<p>For answer MacGowan carefully emptied
his purse into his left palm, and took one or
two coins out of the tiny heap.</p>

<p>‘I owe this to my landlady,’ he said,
referring to the two sovereigns in his right
hand.</p>

<p>There were only three or four left.</p>

<p>‘And is that all you have between you
<span class="lock">and——’</span></p>

<p>MacGowan nodded.</p>

<p>‘Stay here a minute,’ said Alec, after a
moment’s thought. ‘I’ll see if I can make
your peace for you. I can but try.’ And
without waiting for MacGowan’s thanks he
went on with quick steps to the office.</p>

<p>‘So you have dismissed MacGowan,’ said
Alec as soon as he reached the managing
clerk’s room.</p>

<p>‘Yes; lazy, drunken vagabond that he is!’
said Beattie spitefully. ‘I told him that I
should not advise Mr. Hatchett to look over
this offence; so I suppose he took that as
equivalent to a dismissal.’</p>

<p>‘But he will starve! He can’t find
another place without a character for steadiness;
and he has only got three or four
pounds in the world.’</p>

<p>‘What’s that to me?’</p>

<p>‘Beattie, I wish you would give the poor
fellow another chance,’ said Alec, after a
pause. ‘You have only to say nothing of
his absence, and it will never be noticed; or
if you do mention it, say a word in excuse,
and I’m sure Mr. Hatchett would never think
of dismissing him.’</p>

<p>‘Probably not,’ said Beattie drily.</p>

<p>‘Then why won’t you do it?’</p>

<p>‘Because I don’t want a drunken impertinent
fellow like that about the place. And I
don’t see why <em>you</em> need trouble yourself about
him;’ and Beattie turned again to his papers
with something like a sneer on his face.</p>

<p>This was all that was needed to set Alec’s
blood in a flame. He took a step or two
forward, his eyes in a blaze, his hands involuntarily
clenched at his side.</p>

<p>‘Then you prefer to be my enemy rather
than my friend?’ he said, between his
teeth.</p>

<p>Beattie looked up in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Only that I count no man my friend who
refuses me so small a favour.’</p>

<p>And Alec looked as if he meant to have
his way, whether it pleased Mr. William
Beattie or not.</p>

<p>Beattie was half inclined to laugh in the
other’s face, and yet he was impressed in
spite of himself. In one moment he had
mentally run over the circumstances again.
It was one of his maxims never to make an
enemy if he could help it. Was it worth
while making an enemy of young Lindsay?
True, he saw no way in which Lindsay could
injure him—things were rather the other
way. But he might be a rich and influential
man some day. He might have it in his
power to refuse a request from <em>him</em>, or to
advance his interests. These things passed
through the managing clerk’s mind in less
than a second.</p>

<p>‘Oh, if you put it in that way, Lindsay, to
oblige you—I don’t mind looking over it this
time. But you’d better tell him this is his
last chance. And I wish you would let me
have the draft of Sir Joseph Wilson’s settlement
to-night if you can.’</p>

<p>Alec, who was secretly a little ashamed of
his own vehemence, muttered a few words of
thanks; and, going to his own room, scribbled
on a piece of paper, ‘Come back to your old
seat, and say nothing about it.—A. L.’ This
he sent on to MacGowan by one of the clerks
in the outer office.</p>

<p>‘It doesn’t matter,’ said Beattie to himself,
as Alec left him; ‘the creature’s sure to
break out again in a month or two, so it
comes very much to the same thing.’</p>

<p>As Alec left the office that night he found
himself overtaken by MacGowan.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr. Lindsay, sir!’ cried MacGowan,
‘I just canna thank ye ava’!’</p>

<p>‘There’s no need for that,’ said Alec; ‘but
I may as well say this—I shan’t be able to
stand your friend another time; I shall not,
indeed. And I very much fear that if you
misbehave again, Mr. Beattie will turn you
away for good and all.’</p>

<p>‘I dare say, but I’ll no gie him the chance.
I’ll swear to you I’ll keep sober, Mr. Lindsay.
I’ll swear’t to you on my Bible oath. I ken
fine what gar’d him pack me awa’. The ither
clerks ca’ed us “The Twa Scotties,” him and
me; and he didna like it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m glad things have gone all
right. Good-night,’ said Alec, quickening his
pace.</p>

<p>Before he had gone much farther he met
Hubert Blake.</p>

<p>‘By the way,’ said Blake, when they had
exchanged greetings, ‘do you know whom I
saw the other day in Regent Street—an old
friend of yours—that young lady who used
to stay with your uncle—what was her
name?’</p>

<p>‘You mean Miss Mowbray,’ said Alec
quietly.</p>

<p>He spoke in his ordinary tone, but he
could not prevent the quick blush mounting
to his forehead.</p>

<p>After a few unimportant sentences Blake
bade Alec good-night. A smile was on his
lips as he turned away.</p>

<p>‘Poor fellow!’ he said to himself, ‘so he
has not forgotten her!’</p>

</h3>
<h4>AT THE ACADEMY.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Alec</span> had not, indeed, forgotten Laura Mowbray;
though he had long since awakened
from his first dream of love. Now, at twenty-two,
he looked back on himself at nineteen as
not only very young, but very foolish. He
had half forgotten the episode of his wild
declaration of love; but when he heard that
Laura was near him once more, he was filled
with a variety of emotions. At one time he
determined to do nothing, to forget her if he
could; at another time he was almost ready to
set out and begin an insane search for her
through the streets of London. He confessed
to himself that though he had been intimate
with Miss Mowbray he really knew her very
slightly. He wanted to see her again, to
learn something more of her; and yet he
hesitated about deliberately setting to work to
renew the old acquaintance.</p>

<p>As often happens in such a case, chance
decided the matter for him. Two or three
days after hearing that Laura was in town,
Alec received a letter from his sister, in which
she told him that their uncle James and
his family had taken a furnished house in
London, No. 21, Claremont Gardens, W., and
meant to stay there some months.</p>

<p>The old man had become much more
feeble during the last three years. And
instead of making the best of things, and
meeting the inevitable weakness of old age
with a cheerful courage, he chose to consider
himself a great invalid, and made his health
the chief consideration of his life. This, of
course, did not tend to improve either his
health or his temper; and he had been for the
last two years dragging his family about from
one watering-place to another, to Aunt Jean’s
great disgust. She, good woman, was made
of sterner stuff than her rich cousin. She
did not approve of the unsettled life she was
forced to lead; and she did not believe that
her relative was even as much in need of care
and attention as he really was.</p>

<p>As for Laura Mowbray, she possessed that
enviable disposition (shared by people of all
sorts and conditions) of making the best of
things. She took care to keep out of her
guardian’s way when he was in a specially
irritable mood; she flattered and soothed him
not unsuccessfully now and then; she avoided
Miss Lindsay as much as possible; and she
seized upon every opportunity of amusing
herself. She was by no means sorry to visit
first one spa and then another, though she was
forced to witness from the outside gaieties
which no one asked her to share.</p>

<p>‘One day,’ she would say to herself, drawing
her lips over her set teeth, as she sat
listening to the band to which the other guests
in the hotel were dancing. But she often received
attentions from stray visitors, which
helped in some degree to console her for the
lack of amusements. When she heard that
Mr. Lindsay had determined to spend some
months in London, so as to secure the services
of the famous Dr. Sheepshanks, Laura was
overjoyed.</p>

<p>Of course Alec called to ask for his uncle,
and he was quite shocked to find him looking
so ill. His face was pinched and haggard, his
hand thin and trembling; so that, to Alec’s
inexperienced eyes, it seemed as if death had
already set his seal upon him. Old Mr.
Lindsay was secretly pleased with Alec’s
demeanour. The young man could not express
his concern, but it appeared plainly
enough in his face and manner. He evidently
believed that his great-uncle was in a
condition demanding great care, sympathy,
and consideration; and that was exactly what
Mr. Lindsay wanted the world to believe concerning
him. He made Alec sit down beside
him, and asked him many questions in a
feeble, piping voice, about his work, his prospects,
and his ultimate aims. James Lindsay
was entirely changed from the fussy, consequential,
conceited being of three or four
years before. Alec was almost touched by
the meekness and painfulness (so to speak) of
the old man’s manner.</p>

<p>‘That’ll do now, Alec, my man,’ he said,
when he was at length tired of his companion.
‘Go downstairs and see your aunt Jean.’
(Here he sighed and lifted his eyebrows as if
the very mention of that lady’s name gave him
an opportunity of exercising the virtue of
patience.) ‘Come and see me again soon.
Good-day;’ and he lay back as if exhausted,
and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Alec stole on tiptoe from the room, and
went down to the drawing-room, where he
found his aunt (as he called her) seated
alone.</p>

<p>‘I was very sorry to see Uncle James so
poorly,’ said Alec, as he took her hand.</p>

<p>Aunt Jean said nothing; but her sniff and
look of contempt were sufficiently expressive.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think my uncle very ill?’ asked
Alec, opening his eyes.</p>

<p>‘He micht be waur,’ said Aunt Jean.</p>

<p>She always spoke a broader dialect abroad
than she did at home, as a protest against
what she deemed the affectation and ‘mimmou’d’
character of the English utterance.</p>

<p>‘He seemed very weak,’ said Alec, surprised
and a little shocked at the old lady’s
want of sympathy.</p>

<p>‘Maist fowk’s no as strang at seventy-fower
as they were at seventeen,’ replied
Aunt Jean, smoothing out her apron as she
spoke.</p>

<p>Then the conversation turned upon other
matters; and Alec began to fear that he
would have to leave without seeing Laura.
But just as he was preparing to go a knock
was heard at the hall-door, and Laura came in
from a stroll in the gardens.</p>

<p>She looked, it seemed to Alec, exactly the
same as she had done when he last saw her.
But he had not time to think of her looks. It
was she herself, after these years—and three
years are a long period to us all before we are
four-and-twenty—standing before him. His
heart beat as he took her hand, and though he
was able to speak and look as if she were a
mere ordinary acquaintance, each knew that it
was not so. How far her old power over Alec
was broken, Laura did not know; but she
saw quite plainly, from a hundred little indications,
that he was not indifferent to her.
There was very little conversation, and such
as there was was chiefly about trifles—the
respective merits of Harrogate, Buxton, and
Aix-le-Bains, the welfare of Alec’s sister, and
so on. Alec could not afterwards remember
what they talked about, but he remembered
the picture which Laura made, as she sat in a
small, low chair at the window, playing with
one of her gloves, and looking, Alec thought,
more sweet and graceful than any human
being had looked since his eyes had last
rested upon her.</p>

<p>The next time Alec went to ask after his
uncle, he found that his cousin, James Semple,
had arrived from Glasgow, and was staying
in the house. After a short visit to his
uncle’s sick-room, he was passing through
the hall, when he met Semple and Miss
Lindsay.</p>

<p>‘You’ll stay to lunch, Alec, and go with us
to the Academy?’ said Semple, when they
had shaken hands. Miss Mowbray has had
a friend come to see her—she is rather a swell
at painting, and that sort of thing, I believe—and
we intend going to the Academy as soon
as we have finished lunch.</p>

<p>Alec thought it was very good-natured of
Semple to propose that he should join the
party, and he consented at once to stay. In
a few minutes Laura and her friend, Miss
Sewell, made their appearance; and only
Alec’s native sense of propriety prevented his
staring at Miss Sewell with all his might.
She was very tall, very pale, and very thin,
and she was dressed in a rather exaggerated
form of the ‘Greek’ costume. A broad
scarf of the same material as her dress was
carried across her breast, and fastened in some
way upon her left shoulder. Her hair was
gathered into a great knot at the back of her
head; and her sleeves were as tight as sleeves
could by any possibility be. When she spoke
it was in a languid, deliberate way, suggestive
of refinement, and a superior delicacy of
organization. Miss Lindsay regarded this
young lady with mingled amazement and
dislike; and only a strong sense of her duty
as hostess kept her from openly expressing
her condemnation.</p>

<p>The conversation at table was not very
brilliant.</p>

<p>‘Are you fond of pictures, Miss Sewell?’
inquired Mr. Semple from the foot of the
table.</p>

<p>Miss Sewell glanced slowly round at
Laura, as if for enlightenment as to the
purpose of so absurd a question, before she
tranquilly replied:</p>

<p>‘Everyone is, I suppose, Mr. Semple.’</p>

<p>But it was nearly impossible to make that
gentleman feel that one was even trying to
snub him.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ he replied; ‘I know a lot
of men, very intelligent men, who don’t know
a single one of the points of a picture. But
art has made vast strides of late years: there’s
no denying that.’</p>

<p>Miss Sewell slowly and impressively turned
her shoulder on Mr. Semple, and thenceforward
ignored his existence.</p>

<p>It was not till the little party reached
Burlington House that Alec understood the
reason why he had been asked to join
the party. Semple monopolized Laura,
and Alec was expected to look after Miss
Sewell.</p>

<p>The care of that young lady on such an
occasion was no sinecure. She was full of
enthusiasm, which was about one-tenth part
real; and she found in nearly every picture
some indication of genius.</p>

<p>‘What an admirable tone there is in that
little bit!’ she would say.</p>

<p>Alec was dumb.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think the breadth of effect there
is perfectly wonderful?’ she asked, stopping
before a great, aimless, carelessly-painted
canvas.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I—I don’t know what you
mean,’ said Alec.</p>

<p>‘The breadth, the feeling of vastness, of
superiority to—to—you understand?’ replied
Miss Sewell, in a very intense tone.</p>

<p>But Alec was staring at the picture.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what a picture should be,’
said he, very deliberately; ‘but I know what
a hillside <em>is</em>, and <em>that</em> thing has no resemblance
to it whatever.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, we must educate you, Mr. Lindsay,’
said the girl, with a little laugh.</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to be educated!’ said Alec
stoutly. ‘I think half the things here are
coarse, stupid daubs, and half the rest are
pretty, but senseless. They have no meaning.
They don’t help you to love beauty or nature
more—not one bit.’</p>

<p>‘Pray, sir,’ said a caustic voice behind
Alec, ‘did you ever try to paint a picture?’</p>

<p>An old man, with keen black eyes, deep-set
under bushy gray eyebrows, was the
speaker.</p>

<p>‘Never in my life,’ said Alec.</p>

<p>‘Then you don’t know how difficult it is to
paint a good one.’</p>

<p>‘I think it is wonderful that they are half
as good as they are,’ returned Alec.</p>

<p>The stranger stared, and the young man
went on:</p>

<p>‘I think it is wonderful that a man should
be able to make likenesses of mountains,
and seas, and clouds. But as men have
learned how to do it, I think those who
can’t do it better than this,’ pointing at a
picture as he spoke, ‘had better leave their
work at home till they can make it more like
nature. And at least they might choose
beautiful or picturesque subjects, and not
waste their time over tables and chairs, curtains
and rugs, ladies’ dresses and knickknacks.’</p>

<p>The old man smiled grimly, and nodded
once or twice as he turned away.</p>

<p>‘Do find out who that is,’ said Miss Sewell;
‘I feel certain he is somebody.’</p>

<p>Miss Sewell was right. It was Sir Theodore
Carson, the greatest painter of the day;
and Miss Sewell at once resolved to profit by
her experience and abandon enthusiasm for
depreciation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Semple had been asking his
companion:</p>

<p>‘Why does Miss Sewell dress in that absurd
way?’</p>

<p>‘You mustn’t speak disrespectfully of my
friend, sir,’ said Laura. ‘But dear Alice was
always given to fancies. First she was
learned and literary; then she was a regular
athlete—she nearly ruined her health, trying
to walk from London to Bath in two days—or
five days, I forget which. Then she
became original and classical, and slightly
æsthetic. Next time I see her, she is sure to
be something different.’</p>

<p>It was rather a tiresome afternoon for Alec;
but it came to an end at last.</p>

<p>‘What a handsome cousin you have,
Laura!’ said Alice Sewell to her friend in
the privacy of her bedroom that afternoon.</p>

<p>‘Do you think so? I never thought of
Mr. Semple as particularly handsome.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t mean that fat, disagreeable-looking
creature, you stupid girl! I mean the tall
one, Mr. Alec Lindsay. He has beautiful
eyes, and such a strong, independent way of
speaking.’</p>

<p>‘What a curious girl you are, Alice! I
thought he would have been far too unconventional
for you.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you like him?’ asked Alice in
reply.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Laura, in a hesitating way.
She was on the point of telling her friend
that she had had Alec at her feet; but she
refrained.</p>

<p>‘They are both in love with you,’ said
Alice tranquilly. ‘Which do you mean to
take?’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid it must be the other one,’ said
Laura, turning away with a little sigh.</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Alec has so little sense. He might
have been his uncle’s heir, I believe; and he
has simply neglected his interests. He will
always be a poor man.’ And the girl sighed
again.</p>

<p>‘And this Mr. Semple?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he is pretty sure to be rich.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t decide too hastily, Laura, my dear,’
said the elder girl. And Laura smiled, as
much as to say that she perfectly understood
the situation, and felt quite competent to
direct her own affairs.</p>

herself justice.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Nineteen">XIX.</abbr><br>
</h3>
<h4>THE SHADOW OF DEATH.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> the weeks went by, Mr. James Lindsay
grew slowly more feeble. He was no longer
able to go out of doors, and he seldom left
his room. He became more querulous and
more capricious; and this disposition blinded
his friends to his real danger.</p>

<p>But Dr. Sheepshanks saw the truth. He
saw, also, that his patient had no idea that
he was drawing very near the end of his life.
And when a chance remark made the doctor
aware that the old man had not yet made his
will, he thought it was his duty to tell Miss
Lindsay what the state of things really was.</p>

<p>‘Danger!’ she exclaimed, startled and
shocked by the doctor’s words; ‘it’s not
possible!’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid there is no doubt of it, my
dear madam.’</p>

<p>‘But he’s not an old man—not to say old.
His father lived to ninety-three; and two of
his uncles were past eighty.’</p>

<p>Dr. Sheepshanks only shook his head, with
a grave professional smile.</p>

<p>‘I never thought there was muckle wrang
wi’ him.’</p>

<p>‘It is my decided opinion,’ said the doctor,
‘that Mr. Lindsay is not likely to live long.
I think he ought to be told so, and advised
to put his affairs in order.’</p>

<p>And thereupon Dr. Sheepshanks took his
leave.</p>

<p>Miss Lindsay sat perfectly still for some
minutes. She reproached herself for making
light of her cousin’s complaints; and felt
that she was almost humiliated in being
forced to bring to the invalid the unwelcome
tidings. But it was clearly her duty. She
rose suddenly, and went upstairs to his
room.</p>

<p>‘How are ye, Jeems?’ she asked, sitting
down by the bedside.</p>

<p>‘Vera frail, Jean; I doubt I’m no long for
this world. Did the haddies come frae
Dundee?’</p>

<p>‘Yes—but—the fact is, Jeems, I doubt
ye’re waur than I thocht ye.’</p>

<p>The sick man closed his eyes with a contented
sigh. It was satisfactory to find that
his obdurate relative at last believed that he
was really ill. Miss Lindsay wanted to make
some apology for her former attitude, but
apologies did not come readily to her tongue.</p>

<p>‘We ought a’ to be prepared for our hinner
en’, Jeems,’ she said at last.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay opened his eyes suddenly, and
stared at his cousin. Such words from her
meant something.</p>

<p>‘What mak’s ye say that?’ he asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Jean moved uneasily in her seat and
cleared her throat before replying.</p>

<p>‘Weel, ye’re no sae young as ye were, and
life’s an uncertain thing, and ye’re vera far
frae weel.’</p>

<p>The old man again closed his eyes, with a
resigned expression of countenance. He had
no idea of the truth. His cousin saw she
must speak plainly.</p>

<p>‘<cite>And the doctor said I had better warn you.</cite>’</p>

<p>The old man opened his eyes with a start,
and stared at his companion. A look of
horror crept into his face. He tried to speak,
but the words would not come.</p>

<p>‘Did the doctor say that?’ he asked in a
whisper.</p>

<p>‘He did that,’ said the old lady. ‘I
thocht it was no kindness to hide it from
ye, Jeems.’</p>

<p>And after moving about restlessly for a few
moments, she escaped from the room.</p>

<p>There was not a sound but the faint crackling
of the coals in the grate, and the soft
fall, now and then, of a cinder into the ashes.</p>

<p>He was to die. Few men can hear the
sentence unmoved, and James Lindsay was
at heart a coward. He trembled at the
thought of facing the unseen world—trembled
as a murderer when the long-expected hand
is suddenly placed on his shoulder.</p>

<p>For more than an hour he lay still, and
his thoughts wandered back to the time when
he was a ragged urchin at a little village
school. He remembered the school-house
well—the great tree under which he used to
play. He remembered cheating a schoolfellow
once, and the thought of it troubled
him. He wished he had confessed it and
made restitution. It was impossible to make
restitution now.</p>

<p>Then he saw himself a lad working for
weekly wages. He recollected the happy
accident which had given him the opportunity
of making a fortune. He had been bold and
energetic, and he had had his reward. Wealth,
exceeding his wildest dreams, had been his.
What good had it done to him? How few
had been his pleasures! How empty his
life! And now he must leave it, and go
forth into the darkness alone.</p>

<p>He tried to remember his good deeds, his
church-going, his subscriptions to this or
that fund, but they seemed to be all parts of
the ordinary round of his existence, things he
would have been ashamed not to do. Once,
on a wet day, he had given a shilling to a
beggar-woman, and she had blessed him for
it. He was glad to think of that—but oh!
it was such a small thing!</p>

<p>He was startled by a knock at the door.
It was Alec. The dying man looked at him
with envy and something of bitterness.
What would he not give for the lad’s health
and strength, for the years he had yet to
live?</p>

<p>‘Alec,’ said the old man suddenly, ‘I want
you to write a letter for me. Don’t say
anything about it: mind that. Write to Dr.
Mackenzie, the Reverend Robert Mackenzie,
D.D., the Free Gorbals Church, Glasgow,
and tell him I want to see him instantly.’</p>

<p>The letter was soon written and despatched;
and then James Lindsay felt somewhat easier.</p>

<p>It was Saturday afternoon when the letter
reached Dr. Mackenzie’s hands; and it sorely
perplexed the worthy minister. If he were
to put off his journey till Monday morning,
he could not reach London before Monday
night, and the delay might offend the rich
man mortally. But starting at once would
force him to intrust his flock to a very inferior
preacher, and would, besides, involve
the sin of travelling on the Sabbath. No
doubt, if Mr. Lindsay were ill, the case would
come within the saving clause of ‘works of
necessity or mercy.’ He would then be
justified in beginning a long journey on
Saturday night. But how was he to be
sure of Mr. Lindsay’s state of health? He
felt angry with the writer of the letter for
not foreseeing the difficulty and giving more
accurate information. Then he remembered
that Mr. Lindsay had gone abroad for the
sake of his health. What more likely than
that he was very ill? Dr. Mackenzie finally
determined that it was an exceptional case,
and that it would be clearly a work of mercy
to hasten at once to the rich man’s bedside.</p>

<p>He hunted up a minister who made a scanty
living by filling the pulpits of his more
fortunate brethren on emergencies like the
present, and engaged him to preach twice at
the Gorbals Free Church on the following
day, and left Glasgow (not without some
lingering doubts as to the legality of his proceedings)
by the evening mail.</p>

<p>On Sunday forenoon he was standing by
the bedside of his old acquaintance.</p>

<p>‘It’s very kind of ye to come, Doctor,’
said Mr. Lindsay, in a feeble voice; ‘but the
Lord’ll reward ye.’</p>

<p>The minister thought that a mere earthly
reward, at least to the extent of his travelling
expenses, would likewise be desirable; but he
merely answered:</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry to find you going down the hill,
Mr. Lindsay.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, it’s a road we maun a’ travel, Doctor.
They tell me I’m near the end o’t.’</p>

<p>‘And I trust you are at peace in your
mind?’</p>

<p>‘Not as I would like—not as I would like
to be, Dr. Mackenzie.’</p>

<p>‘Ye should rest on the promises, my friend,’
said the minister, and he repeated various texts
of the Bible bearing upon the forgiveness of
sins.</p>

<p>The old man listened almost impatiently.</p>

<p>‘I ken a’ that,’ he said, as the minister
ended. ‘I havena been an elder of the Free
Kirk thirty years for nothing. But how am
I to ken they apply to me?’</p>

<p>‘They are for all men,’ answered the
minister.</p>

<p>‘Just so; but all men are not saved.’</p>

<p>‘Because they do not believe.’</p>

<p>‘If I believe I’m saved, I <em>am</em> saved?
That’s about it, it seems to me.’</p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t put it in that way. There is
such a thing as false assurance.’</p>

<p>‘Then how am I to know that mine is not
a false assurance?’ and the old man looked
anxiously in the minister’s face.</p>

<p>‘You have only to accept forgiveness as a
free gift, and it is yours,’ said the other, falling
back on his formula.</p>

<p>‘But surely I must repent of my sins?’</p>

<p>‘Of course.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t know that I do repent—that
is, not as I should. And after all, Doctor, it’s
not what I have done that troubles me, so
much as what I have not done. You don’t
remember any texts, now, bearing on that?’</p>

<p>Dr. Mackenzie frowned, and took a pinch
of snuff.</p>

<p>‘I can’t just say that I do—not at this
moment,’ he said at last. ‘But I don’t think
you have any cause to reproach yourself on
that score, Mr. Lindsay; you have always
subscribed liberally to the Sustentation Fund,
the Aged Ministers’ Scheme, and the Missionary
Society. I don’t think you have any special
cause for alarm.’</p>

<p>But the sick man looked dissatisfied.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been thinking, Doctor, what I should
do wi’ my siller,’ he said. Dr. Mackenzie
was all attention. ‘I’ve none nearer me than
Lindsay o’ the Castle Farm; and he’s a man
of nearly my own age. He doesna want a
great heap o’ siller. If I leave him enough
to free his land, and maybe buy back one o’
the auld farms, it will be plenty. Then
there’s my nephews. What would be the use
o’ making these young men rich all on a
sudden? They would only waste the money.
Better to let them work for it.’</p>

<p>‘I quite agree with you,’ said Dr. Mackenzie
heartily.</p>

<p>‘I’m not so rich as folk say,’ went on
Mr. Lindsay; ‘but after providing for my
relations in a small way, I have a good
deal left. Doctor, do you think it would
mak’ up for things a bit, if I was to leave
five hundred thousand to the Free Kirk?’</p>

<p>The minister was more than astonished.
He started and drew a long breath.</p>

<p>‘What do you think?’ asked the old man
anxiously.</p>

<p>‘I cannot just say it would mak’ up for
things. We have no merits of our own, ye
ken. They are all but filthy rags. But it’s
a grand idea, and well worth tryin’!’</p>

<p>This was not the solid encouragement for
which Mr. Lindsay had hoped.</p>

<p>‘It will doubtless redound to your credit,
and win ye an increase of glory,’ said the
minister again, noticing his penitent’s disappointed
look.</p>

<p>The sick man sighed. He would have
been satisfied at that moment if he could
have felt certain of a very moderate share of
glory.</p>

<p>‘You think so?’ he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>‘I am certain of it.’</p>

<p>‘Then I’ll do it!’ exclaimed the old man,
striking his fist on the bedclothes. ‘I’ll send
for a lawyer the first thing in the morning.
How do you think it should be left?’</p>

<p>‘I would vest it in trustees, for the general
purposes of the Church, to be used at their
discretion.’</p>

<p>‘Very well. Will you be one of the
trustees?’</p>

<p>Dr. Mackenzie was prepared for this question,
and he had already decided to decline
the honour. He did not see how even the
smallest pecuniary benefit would flow to him
from accepting it.</p>

<p>‘I think I would rather not,’ he replied.
‘One should always appoint young men as
trustees. But, if you have no objection, I
would consent to be secretary to the trust.
If you were to mention my name in the will,
now, just recommending me to the trustees as
their secretary, I would really be much obliged.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll do that,’ said Mr. Lindsay. He quite
understood the minister’s reasons for choosing
the humbler post, and thought none the less
of his friend for this display of prudence.
‘Of course you’ll stop here as long as you
can; it will be a comfort to me. I’ll tell
Miss Lindsay to get your room ready.’</p>

<p>Dr. Mackenzie said that he would, and
reflected, as he went downstairs, that it would
be a comfort to himself to stay till the will
was duly executed.</p>

<p>In the library he found Alec, who often
found his way to Claremont Gardens on a
Sunday morning, partly because it was an
excuse to himself for not going to church
alone, partly because there was always a
chance that he might be able to accompany
Miss Lindsay and Laura to some place of
worship. On this occasion he had been disappointed.
No one had stirred out since the
morning; and he was idly turning over the
pages of the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> when the
minister entered the room.</p>

<p>‘I believe you are Dr. Mackenzie,’ said
Alec, getting up and holding out his hand.</p>

<p>‘Yes. I don’t remember to have <span class="lock">had——’</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, it was I who wrote and asked you to
come.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! just so. You have not gone to
church to-day, Mr. Alexander.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ returned Alec shortly, returning to
his seat.</p>

<p>‘Whom do you generally sit under in
London? Dr. Bruce? or Mr. Martin?’</p>

<p>‘Neither. I sometimes go to St. Paul’s,
oftener to Westminster Abbey.’</p>

<p>Dr. Mackenzie frowned heavily.</p>

<p>‘Is the Gospel preached there, Mr. Alexander?’
he said in a tone that was meant to
be one of deep solemnity.</p>

<p>‘I really can’t say. I suppose so.’</p>

<p>‘You go chiefly for the music, perhaps.’</p>

<p>‘Partly, no doubt.’</p>

<p>‘For the gratification of a sensuous taste!
the indulgence of a carnal delight! There is
no spiritual worship in such places—none!
It is turning the house of God into a concert-room;
nothing less! Ah! this country was
never properly reformed. It was done in a
very half-hearted way. We want a new
Reformation, that shall sweep away the
remnants of idolatrous practices that yet
defile what is nominally Protestant worship.’</p>

<p>The minister walked up and down the little
room in his excitement, gesticulating as he
went, to the manifest peril of a statuette on a
bracket.</p>

<p>Alec rose, and gravely removed the ornament
to a place of safety.</p>

<p>‘No great harm if the heathen image had
been knocked down,’ said Dr. Mackenzie
grimly. ‘And let me tell you, young gentleman,
that the best of Scotland’s sons have
been those who were loyal to her reformed
and Scriptural form of church government
and public worship.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps so,’ said Alec, seeing that he
was expected to say something. ‘I know a
good many, however, who have not done
so.’</p>

<p>‘You know a good many young Scotchmen
in London, perhaps?’</p>

<p>‘A good many.’</p>

<p>‘And are not those who are faithful to their
early training Sabbath-keepers, church-goers—I
don’t mean church-concert-goers—are
they not respected and prosperous, and successful
in their business?’</p>

<p>‘They are,’ said Alec, ‘and not one of them
now believes what he was brought up to
believe.’</p>

<p>‘What? What do you say? How can
you decide on a point that must lie between
each man and his Maker?’</p>

<p>‘Because I have asked them,’ answered
Alec. ‘Each chooses his own road. Some
differ from the orthodox Presbyterian belief
on one point, some on another, but none hold
it in its entirety.’</p>

<p>‘There are many non-essential points,’
began the minister; but he was not sorry
that at this point the door opened, and Miss
Lindsay, followed by Laura, entered the room.</p>

<p>Presently luncheon was announced, and
Semple, who was just then paying one of
his frequent visits from Glasgow, joined the
others on their way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>The minister’s ‘blessing’ was of a kind
more usual in Scotland forty years ago than
it is now. He prayed for the master of the
house, and for all his necessities, and for
various spiritual and temporal blessings for
each member of the household. Suddenly he
seemed to remember the object with which he
had started, and came to an abrupt conclusion
with an adaptation of the usual formula.</p>

<p>Various subjects of conversation were
begun in a languid way, but Dr. Mackenzie
ingeniously and successfully turned
them all into a religious channel in a very
short space of time. He did not approve,
upon principle, of any conversation on Sunday
upon matters of a more profane nature than
the merits of popular preachers, the existence
or non-existence of Sunday-schools and Bible-classes
in various places, the spread of Presbyterianism
in England, and similar topics. As
soon as anyone wandered away to secular
subjects, Dr. Mackenzie went out, and headed
him, so to speak, and drove him back.</p>

<p>The meal proved, in consequence, a dull
one, and matters did not improve when it was
over and the little party returned to the
library.</p>

<p>‘Folk don’t keep the Sabbath as they used
to do in my young days,’ said Miss Lindsay,
with a weak attempt to propitiate the
minister.</p>

<p>‘So much the worse for them, ma’am,’ said
Dr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p>‘When I was a young woman, everybody
attended both diets of worship. Walking for
pleasure on the Sabbath, reading story-books,
and the like, was never heard of.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not; but the old godly ways
are deserted now. Do you think it is a right
thing to read such a paper as that on this holy
day?’ he continued, speaking to Alec, who
had thoughtlessly picked up the <cite>Saturday
Review</cite>.</p>

<p>‘I see no harm in it,’ returned Alec
shortly.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw Semple, who (fortunately
for him) was out of Dr. Mackenzie’s
range of vision, lay down one of Ouida’s
novels, making a grimace at Laura as he
did so.</p>

<p>‘You defy the law of God, then, and choose
the portion of the Sabbath-breaker. <span class="lock">You——’</span></p>

<p>‘Dr. Mackenzie,’ said Alec quietly, ‘have
I presumed to pass judgment on your actions,
and condemn them?’</p>

<p>The minister only stared.</p>

<p>‘You do not pretend to any sacerdotal
authority, I believe?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly not.’</p>

<p>‘Then by what power or authority, I may
ask, do you claim to interfere with me?’</p>

<p>And having said this, Alec tossed the newspaper
aside and left the room, with the words
‘law of God,’ ‘Fourth Commandment,’ ‘judgment,’
ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>After ascertaining that his uncle had fallen
asleep, Alec went off to his own lodgings in
no very Christian frame of mind. And Dr.
Mackenzie neither forgot nor forgave the way
in which the reprobate (as he considered him)
had received his timely reproof.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty">XX.</abbr><br>
</h3>
<h4>MR. LINDSAY’S WILL.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Early</span> the following morning Dr. Mackenzie
despatched a note in Mr. Lindsay’s name to
Messrs. Hatchett, Small, and Hatchett, asking
that one of the firm should call upon him
as soon as possible, and take his instructions
for the making of his will. This note was delivered
in the afternoon, and was in due course
passed on to Mr. Beattie, with the words
pencilled across it, ‘Please attend to this at
once.’ Mr. Hatchett and Mr. Small were
both too important men to attend in person
and take instructions for a will, and the
junior partner happened to be in America.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Beattie to himself, as he glanced
at the note, ‘this will decide our friend Lindsay’s
future. I wonder whether Semple will
come in for a good share. Surely, if he does,
he won’t trouble me about that six hundred I
owe him?’</p>

<p>About four o’clock Beattie presented himself
at Mr. Lindsay’s house, and was at once
shown up to the sick man’s chamber.</p>

<p>‘Are you Mr. Hatchett, or Mr. Small?’
was Mr. Lindsay’s first question.</p>

<p>‘Neither. My name is Beattie. I am the
managing clerk of the conveyancing department.
It was quite impossible for one of the
partners to come to-day; and as you seemed
to wish your will made at <span class="lock">once——’</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, very well, sit down,’ interrupted the
old man.</p>

<p>He was by no means pleased that a clerk
had been sent to him; but it was not worth
while to dispute the point.</p>

<p>Beattie found writing materials on a side-table,
and seated himself at the bedside, with
his pen in his hand.</p>

<p>‘First of all, sir,’ he began, ‘I shall want
your full name and address. By the way, you
have lived here for some months, I believe?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘And you have no intention of returning to
Scotland?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said the old man grimly.</p>

<p>‘I mean, if you recover?’</p>

<p>‘Not permanently.’</p>

<p>‘Have you any will now existing?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>For some minutes there was silence, and
then Mr. Lindsay named the two friends whom
he wished to be his trustees and executors.
Then there was a longer pause. At last the
sick man broke the silence, speaking rapidly,
as if he feared that even then he might change
his mind.</p>

<p>‘Sell my houses, and all that’s in them—nobody
will care for them after I am gone.
Sell the oil-works at Drumleck, and the business.
They have been mismanaged sadly of
late; besides, the trade is not what it was,
and I doubt if there’s much more to be made
in it,’ he added, as if speaking to himself.
‘Then my brother, Alexander Lindsay, of the
Castle Farm, Muirburn, must have ten thousand
pounds. And my second cousin, Jean
Lindsay, who has been my housekeeper for
many years, ten thousand. Have you put
that down?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘To my niece, Margaret Lindsay, three
thousand, and to my ward, Laura Mowbray,
say two thousand. I pity that lassie’s husband,’
he added, under his breath.</p>

<p>Again there was a long pause, so long that
Beattie dried his writing, and looked up as if
to ask whether the instructions were ended.</p>

<p>‘And I bequeath,’ said the old man in a
firm voice, ‘to all those who have been
Moderators of the General Assembly of the
Free Church of Scotland, to the present
Moderator, and to every succeeding Moderator,
the sum of five hundred thousand pounds, in
trust for the Free Church of Scotland, to be
used, at their discretion, for the general purposes
of that body.’</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay glanced at the lawyer as he
pronounced these words, that he might see
what effect the magnitude of the bequest had
upon him; but, to the old man’s disappointment,
Mr. Beattie’s face remained perfectly
impassive. ‘For the general purposes of
that body,’ he repeated, writing down the
words.</p>

<p>‘And I request these trustees to appoint
my friend the Rev. Robert Mackenzie, D.D.,
Secretary to the Trust, at such reasonable
salary as they may think fit. And, by the
way, I leave the said Rev. Robert Mackenzie
one thousand pounds, for himself. The rest
of my property—what do you call it?’</p>

<p>‘The residue.’</p>

<p>‘Ay. The residue I leave to my nephews,
James Semple and Alexander Lindsay, equally
between them. I calculate that will give them
some ten thousand apiece.’</p>

<p>‘By the way, have you personal property
to the extent of half a million?’ inquired the
clerk.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘I only asked, because otherwise there
might be a difficulty about the Statutes of
Mortmain. But I can make the legacy to the
Free Church come out of the personalty.
Have you any further instructions?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Then I will read over what I have written,
and if it is in accordance with your wishes,
you will please initial it.’</p>

<p>This was done, and Beattie took his leave,
promising that the draft would be ready in a
day or two.</p>

<p>As he reached the hall, he met James
Semple, who was coming out of the library.</p>

<p>‘Come in here a moment, Beattie,’ said
Semple, drawing him into the room, which
was empty. ‘What have you been about
with my uncle?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t speak of a client’s business, you
know,’ answered Beattie with a smile.</p>

<p>‘Oh, stuff! Don’t come the virtuous to
such an extent as that. Weren’t you taking
down his instructions for his will?’</p>

<p>Beattie smiled again.</p>

<p>‘Really, my dear fellow, consider my
position,’ he began.</p>

<p>‘I am certain you were. Now, look here.
Am I to have the business at Drumleck, or
am I not?’</p>

<p>But the other was dumb.</p>

<p>‘We can’t talk here,’ said Semple nervously.
‘It’s past five; there’s no necessity
for you to go back to the office, is there?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Then, will you come and dine with me at
the Cosmopolitan, say at half-past six? I
can’t very well ask you to dine here, you
know.’</p>

<p>Beattie accepted the invitation. He knew
very well that Semple’s object in giving it
was to extract information from him about
the will; and Semple told himself that if
Beattie had not meant to yield, he would not
have promised to dine with him. But
Beattie had by no means made up his mind
on the point. One thing, however, he hardly
needed to decide—he did not intend to sell
his information for nothing.</p>

<p>Semple secured a private room at the
Cosmopolitan, and ordered a good dinner and
the best wine procurable.</p>

<p>There was but little conversation between
the two young men during dinner; but as
soon as the meal was concluded, Semple’s
impatience made him open the subject which
was uppermost in their minds.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Beattie,’ he began; ‘I’ve
been a good friend to you, haven’t I?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you have, Semple.’</p>

<p>‘I lent you six hundred pounds, you
know—about that matter—on very bad
security.’</p>

<p>‘You did.’</p>

<p>‘Well, fill your glass, old man.’</p>

<p>Beattie obeyed; but the other noticed that
he merely put the glass to his lips.</p>

<p>‘Come now, Beattie,’ said Semple, ‘I
really think you might oblige me in that little
matter we were speaking of. You see, I
want to have a talk with my uncle about it;
but I must first know what his ideas
are.’</p>

<p>‘How could I do such a thing? Suppose
Hatchett’s people were to get wind of it,
what would be the consequence?’</p>

<p>‘Tuts, man! they can never know of
it!’</p>

<p>‘I should be ruined.’</p>

<p>‘There’s not the slightest chance of it.’</p>

<p>‘I should be constantly in your power.’</p>

<p>‘That means you want to drive a bargain
with me.’</p>

<p>‘I thought you might sign this, perhaps,’
said Beattie, drawing a paper from his
pocket.</p>

<p>It was a receipt in full for six hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>‘Well, you <em>are</em> cool!’ cried Semple,
greatly admiring his friend’s impudence.</p>

<p>‘Will you sign it?’</p>

<p>‘Of course not. I should be mad to do
such a thing. Why, I can ask my uncle at
any time what his intentions are.’</p>

<p>‘Then why come to me?’ asked Beattie
slowly, lifting his eyebrows.</p>

<p>‘It would be convenient to know beforehand,
certainly; but it’s not worth that,’
said Semple.</p>

<p>‘I think you’ll find it’s worth a good deal,’
said the other, smiling again.</p>

<p>This whetted Semple’s curiosity, and roused
his anxiety.</p>

<p>‘Come now, let me see the instructions—I
know you have the paper about you—and
I’ll let you off a hundred.’</p>

<p>‘And not trouble me for the balance for
three years?’</p>

<p>‘Well, yes; and that’s all I’ll do. I’ve
made up my mind.’</p>

<p>Beattie saw that no better terms were to
be obtained, so he rang for pen and ink,
altered the word ‘six’ into ‘one’ in the
receipt with which he had provided himself,
and then it was signed.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said Semple.</p>

<p>Without speaking a word, Beattie drew the
paper of instructions from his pocket, and laid
it on the table.</p>

<p>Semple snatched it up hastily; and the
other sat watching him, knocking off, now
and then, the ash from the end of his cigarette
with his little finger.</p>

<p>Semple ran hurriedly through the first part
of the document; then suddenly he gave a
cry, and started up, as white as a sheet.</p>

<p>‘Sit down, man,’ said Beattie, almost
alarmed at the expression on his companion’s
face. ‘Sit down, and drink this,’ and he
poured him out a glass of port.</p>

<p>Semple took it with a hand that trembled
so as to spill the wine, and drank it off.
Then he burst out in a torrent of imprecations.</p>

<p>‘I knew that —— old minister would
make him put down something for his
religion, but I never dreamt of such madness
as this!’</p>

<p>Beattie said nothing; on the whole he
rather enjoyed his friend’s discomfiture.</p>

<p>‘It’s infamous! And I, to have slaved
all my life for nothing—nothing, by ——!
That half-million is about all he has.’</p>

<p>‘You are to have half the residue, you
see,’ said Beattie; ‘about ten thousand
pounds, I believe.’</p>

<p>‘And what’s that? He might as well
have left me ten thousand farthings! I
ought to have had a hundred thousand pounds
at least. But I won’t submit to it! I will
not. I will dispute the will. My uncle is
not in a fit state of mind to make a will.
Eh, Beattie?’</p>

<p>Beattie was leaning with his arms on the
table, as he slowly pressed the end of his
cigarette against the ash-tray. On hearing
his companion’s last words, he slowly shook
his head without looking up.</p>

<p>‘When I saw him this afternoon, Mr.
Lindsay was in perfect possession of his
faculties,’ he said calmly. (The other darted
at him a look of contempt.) ‘And the doctor
who attends him, as well as his relations and
servants, would no doubt be of the same
opinion,’ he added firmly.</p>

<p>Semple dropped his eyes on the table, and
was silent.</p>

<p>‘Is there no one who has influence with
him, no one who might induce him to alter
his mind?’ added the young lawyer, after a
pause.</p>

<p>‘Nobody in the world,’ said Semple
bitterly. ‘My uncle is the very incarnation
of self-conceit and obstinacy. Everybody
will talk of this “munificent bequest,” and
that’s all he cares for. I will try, of course,
what I can do; but there’s not the slightest
<span class="lock">chance——’</span></p>

<p>‘Take care that you don’t let him see that
you know his intentions before he speaks of
them himself,’ said Beattie anxiously.</p>

<p>‘You needn’t be afraid,’ said the other.</p>

<p>There was silence in the room for some
minutes, while Semple sat brooding over the
prospect before him, his eyes on the floor.
Suddenly he started to his feet, and, striking
the table with his fist, cried, with an
oath:</p>

<p>‘I won’t stand it! I will not! I’m not
going to be fooled out of all this money after
toiling for it so long. Beattie, you must
help me to get it. There are ways and
means. You lawyers know them. I’ll take
any reasonable risk myself, and you shall
have half-profits—that is, two hundred
thousand out of the five. That’s fair, isn’t
it?’</p>

<p>Beattie smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>‘May I ask you what you were thinking
of?’ he inquired, with mock politeness.</p>

<p>‘I’m thinking of getting the money,’ said
Semple roughly. ‘And if you’re too much
of a coward to help me, I’ll find someone
who will! Think, man. Is there no way?
Can’t we find someone who’—here he
dropped his voice to a whisper—‘who could
imitate the signature, you know.’</p>

<p>‘And find ourselves in a convict prison for
the rest of our lives? No, thank you.’</p>

<p>‘But it’s awful to think of such a sum
slipping away from one like that. It’s a sin
not to make an <span class="lock">effort——’</span></p>

<p>Here Mr. Semple stopped; his ideas were
getting rather mixed.</p>

<p>‘You’ll think it over,’ said he, after a long
pause.</p>

<p>‘I’ll think it over,’ repeated the other.</p>

<p>‘Then you think there’s a chance <span class="lock">of——’</span></p>

<p>‘A chance? Well, hardly that. And
yet, as you say, it would be a pity to miss an
opportunity of—two hundred thousand pounds,
I think you said?’</p>

<p>‘If I take the risk, one hundred thousand,
Beattie. It’s a large sum.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ll think it over. Good-night,’
said Beattie, abruptly holding out his hand.
‘By the way,’ he added, turning back as he
reached the door, ‘you had better give me a
call to-morrow morning, before I go down to
the office, for there’s no time to lose. I will
expect you at half-past eight. Something
may have occurred to me in the meantime.’</p>

<p>It happened that that very evening Alec
Lindsay called at his uncle’s, and as soon as
the old man was aware that his nephew was
in the house, he sent for him.</p>

<p>‘Alec,’ he said, ‘sit down. I have something
to say to you.’</p>

<p>Alec obeyed, wondering what was coming.</p>

<p>‘I am decidedly of opinion,’ said Mr.
Lindsay, in his old pragmatical way, ‘that it
is not a good thing for a young man to be
made suddenly rich. If he has enough to
give him a start in life, that is all he needs.
Wealth is often the occasion of a young man’s
ruin. Therefore I have not made you my
heir.’</p>

<p>‘I hope you never thought I was expecting
anything of the kind,’ said Alec quickly.</p>

<p>‘No. So you won’t be disappointed. I
have not forgotten you in my will. You will
have a competency. I have not forgotten
any of my relations who had natural claims
on me. But I have thought it right to leave
the bulk of my property to the Kirk. The
will is not drawn up yet. I had a man here
to-day from your office, taking down the
heads of what I want done. I must say
I think one of the partners might have
come.’</p>

<p>‘They are very much engaged.’</p>

<p>‘So this Mr. Beattie said. But I don’t
want to have a clerk that I don’t know
anything about attending to such an important
matter. I should like you to see to
it yourself. You do that sort of work in the
office, don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes—but—— The fact is, uncle, I had
rather not meddle with it, especially if my
name is to be in the will.’</p>

<p>‘Tuts, man, what does that signify?’</p>

<p>‘Not much in reality, <span class="lock">but——’</span></p>

<p>‘You can tell one of the partners that it is
my wish.’</p>

<p>‘That would be a very awkward thing for
me to do.’</p>

<p>‘You’re very particular. It’s not such
a great favour to ask of you. Will you do it
if I write to the firm, and say I prefer that
you should draw up the will?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, uncle. I am very willing to oblige
you; but if you are really anxious that I
should do it, you had better write to the firm
about it.’</p>

<p>‘Then I will write a note now, and have
it posted to-night, so that they may get it
in the morning. That’s all I wanted to
say to you. Just ask your aunt Jean to
come here for a minute, when you go
down.’</p>

<p>Alec found Miss Lindsay sitting with
Laura in the library, and delivered his
message.</p>

<p>‘What secrets have you and my uncle been
discussing?’ asked the girl, as soon as the
elder lady had left the room.</p>

<p>(Laura had dropped into the way of calling
Mr. Lindsay ‘uncle,’ though no relationship
existed between them.)</p>

<p>‘None that I know of,’ answered Alec.</p>

<p>‘Come now, don’t tell me a fib,’ said Laura,
smiling, and holding up her forefinger. ‘You
shouldn’t try to be deceitful. It is of no use,
for your face betrays you. There was a
stranger here this afternoon, a dark, silent
kind of man. He came to see uncle, and
I believe it was to make his will. Am I
not right?’</p>

<p>‘Possibly.’</p>

<p>‘Of course I am. My guesses are always
right. I wonder who is to be the favoured
one? I do hope it will be you, Alec!’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ he answered with some
confusion.</p>

<p>‘Ah! I see you know all about it. Uncle
and you were talking it over just now,
weren’t you?’</p>

<p>‘If we were, you know I can’t speak of
what passed between us.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I know that, of course. Still, I am
a little curious. Not with regard to myself,
personally. I have no right to expect that
Mr. Lindsay should leave me anything, for
after all (though he has been as kind as any
blood-relation could be to me), he and I are
not related. You remember my telling you
that, the first time we met? You remember
that night? You sat next me at dinner, and
your cousin was so jealous of my talking
to you!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I remember that night very well.’</p>

<p>‘But I <em>should</em> like to know that uncle had
done his duty by you. He has so much
money; and as you are his favourite nephew,
he is certain to leave you quite a large sum.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t see that at all. I mean, I have
no claim on him whatever.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes! you have,’ said Laura; but she
stopped suddenly, for Miss Lindsay just then
returned to the room.</p>

<p>As Alec went home that night, Laura’s
image remained with him. And more than
once the thought occurred to him, that if his
uncle carried out his intention of leaving him
a substantial sum, it would bring the possibility
of his winning Laura Mowbray a little
nearer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-one">XXI.</abbr><br>
</h3>
<h4>ROGUES IN COUNCIL.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> James Semple went to keep his early
appointment with the lawyer’s clerk on the
following morning, his great fear was that
Beattie might in the meantime have changed
his mind. For himself, his indignation and
rage knew no bounds. He felt ready to run
any risks. But he knew that without the aid
of his astute friend he was powerless; and
the sense of his impotence only added to his
anger.</p>

<p>‘Well, here you are,’ said Beattie, when
Semple was shown into his room. ‘Sit down,
and have a cup of coffee.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t mind if I do. And you might
put a dash of brandy in it. It’s terribly cold
to-day. Don’t you find it so?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘I dare say not. You’d find no weather
cold; you’re cold-blooded, like a leech.’</p>

<p>As soon as the two men were left alone
together, Semple drew his chair nearer to
Beattie’s and leant forward.</p>

<p>‘Have you thought of anything?’ he asked
in a whisper.</p>

<p>Beattie looked at the other’s hungry,
wolfish eyes, and turned away, half in disgust.</p>

<p>‘It seems to me, as you said last night,
almost a sin not to try to prevent so gross an
act of folly as the one we were speaking of,’
he said at last. ‘And a plan has occurred
to me that might possibly succeed.’</p>

<p>‘Really! You’re a brick, Beattie. I
always said you were. I always knew you
had twice as much brains as most fellows.’</p>

<p>Beattie took no notice of this.</p>

<p>‘There is a risk about it, no doubt. There
always must be in such cases. But I think
the danger may be reduced to a minimum.’</p>

<p>‘What is it? What is your idea?’</p>

<p>‘It will require some care and adroitness
on your part, when the critical moment
arrives; but I shall ask you to do nothing
impossible, or even difficult.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t do any forg——, if you mean
that,’ said Semple, with a slight shiver. ‘I
really couldn’t. I mean, I haven’t the skill.’</p>

<p>Beattie threw a contemptuous glance at his
companion.</p>

<p>‘You surely forget what I said on that
point last night,’ he said coldly.</p>

<p>‘But how else are you to manage it?
What is your idea?’</p>

<p>‘I may as well tell you now that I don’t
take another step unless you give me back
that promissory note of mine. You can sign
a receipt for the money now, and send me the
note when you return to Glasgow. I will
burn them both. “Dead men tell no
tales.”’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but you know, old man, that’s too
much. I let you off a hundred only last
night.’</p>

<p>‘What has that to do with it? I gave you
a return for the hundred, didn’t I? I tell
you I have made up my mind that the old
debt must be cleared out of the way to begin
with, and I must have half profits if we
succeed.’</p>

<p>‘Half profits! Why, you couldn’t touch a
penny of it without me!’</p>

<p>‘Nor could you without me.’</p>

<p>And after a little wrangling, Semple was
forced to consent to these conditions.</p>

<p>‘Now, what is your precious plan?’ he
asked, when he had signed the necessary
paper.</p>

<p>‘I think you had better leave that to me,’
said Beattie, as he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>‘That’s cool, I must say!’</p>

<p>‘As you like,’ answered the other, shrugging
his shoulders; ‘but it seems to me that
it’s much safer for you to know nothing. I
may very probably want your help. But in
case of anything coming out, the less you
know the better.’</p>

<p>‘I see. All right.’</p>

<p>‘There is one unfortunate circumstance.
We can’t secure the whole half-million. We
can only get about half of it.’</p>

<p>‘Half of it! Why didn’t you tell me
that sooner? Do you think I would have
gone shares with you, if I had known that?
I won’t do it, and that’s flat.’</p>

<p>Semple could be obstinate enough when he
liked; and in the end a compromise was
effected. If Semple realized two hundred
thousand pounds from his uncle’s estate,
Beattie was to have half of the whole. All
above two hundred thousand the former was
to keep for himself.</p>

<p>‘And now you had better go, as I must go
down to the office,’ said Beattie. ‘Well, it’s
worth the risk,’ he muttered to himself when
he was left alone. ‘A hundred thousand
pounds. A very fair sum. Enough to be
the foundation of a first-rate fortune,’ And
with this pleasant thought in his mind he
set out for Theobald’s Road.</p>

<p>Mr. Hatchett was before him that morning,
and was busy opening letters when he
arrived.</p>

<p>‘There’s a note from that Mr. Lindsay
whom you saw last night,’ said the solicitor,
tossing it across the table. ‘He wants his
nephew to draw his will. He can do it, I
suppose?’</p>

<p>Beattie stood with the note in his hand
without answering.</p>

<p>‘It doesn’t matter how it is done, for of
course you will send the draft to counsel.’</p>

<p>‘There won’t be time for that, I’m afraid,’
said Beattie slowly.</p>

<p>‘Ah! The old man is dying, is he?
Then you can look over the draft yourself,
you know.’ And Mr. Hatchett began speaking
about another matter, to which the
managing clerk was forced to give his
attention.</p>

<p>When the interview was over, Beattie went
to his own room, and throwing on the table
the letters and papers which he carried, he
sat down and leant his head upon his hand.
Then he took up a pen and began idly drawing
lines from one blot to another on his
writing-pad. Did Alec Lindsay know of this
whim of his uncle’s? Probably he did.
And if he did not, would it be safe to disregard
it? These were the questions that were
troubling him.</p>

<p>He was still sitting in the same attitude
when a knock came to the door. He started
up, and drew one of the papers towards him,
as if he were reading it.</p>

<p>‘Come in!’ he cried, and Alec Lindsay
walked into the room.</p>

<p>‘Good morning, Beattie. Have you seen
the letters to-day?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Was there one from my uncle?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I saw it.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a great nuisance,’ said Alec, seating
himself on a corner of the table. ‘I had very
much rather not have anything to do with
drawing the will, especially as I believe I am
to be one of the legatees.’</p>

<p>‘It is hardly usual, certainly. But you
are rather busy just now, I think. I’ll do the
will for you if you like.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you. But my uncle made me
promise that I would see to it myself. I will
send the draft to counsel.’</p>

<p>‘There isn’t time for that,’ said Beattie in
a decided tone. ‘Mr. Battiwell would keep
the draft for a week—three days at least—and
your uncle particularly wished it done at
once. If anything should happen in the
<span class="lock">meantime——’</span></p>

<p>‘I see. Well, you will look over the draft
after I have done it?’</p>

<p>‘If you like. But it’s the easiest thing in
the world. A child might do it. You have
nothing to do but follow the precedent. By
the way,’ he added, ‘I suppose your uncle has
told you of his intentions?’</p>

<p>‘He told me he meant to leave the bulk of
his property to the Free Church.’</p>

<p>‘What can have put such an absurd notion
into his head?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I fancy a Dr. Mackenzie, who is
staying with him just now, may have had
something to do with it.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! A minister, I suppose. Your uncle
is a good deal under his influence, I dare
say?’</p>

<p>‘No; I don’t think so. And really I
don’t know that Dr. Mackenzie even suggested
it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s no business of mine,’ said
Beattie, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>‘Will you give me the paper of instructions?’
said Alec, after a pause.</p>

<p>‘Certainly; here it is.’ And Mr. Beattie
turned to the other documents before him,
with an air that said, ‘I have wasted too
many minutes already.’</p>

<p>But as soon as Alec had left the room, he
relapsed into his former attitude. Presently
he rose and paced up and down the room with
slow, cat-like steps. Then he paused at the
window, and stood there for more than half an
hour, looking out at the blank wall opposite
him. ‘That might do,’ he said to himself at
last, as he turned away. ‘It ought to succeed.
There is a risk, certainly; but we can’t help
that.’</p>

<p>Then Mr. Beattie put on his hat, and
going to a telegraph-office some little way
off, he sent this message to his friend James
Semple:</p>

<p>‘Meet me at the Cosmopolitan this afternoon
at four o’clock.’</p>

<p>About three o’clock he went into Alec
Lindsay’s room.</p>

<p>‘Well, how are you getting on with the
will?’</p>

<p>‘The draft is nearly finished. I have not
been able to go on with it steadily, or it would
have been done sooner. Will you look over
it now?’</p>

<p>‘You can put it on my table when it is
ready. I suppose you will send it to your
uncle to-night?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. I will send it by to-night’s post.’</p>

<p>‘You had better say in your note that if
the draft is satisfactory it may be returned to
us to-night, and we will bring it to be
executed on Thursday morning. There will
be plenty of time to have it engrossed to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Very well. I will do that.’</p>

<p>‘And, I say, Lindsay, I think you had
better not send it to the law stationer’s.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because the man who copied your draft at
the law stationer’s would be sure to speak of
it. How foolish your uncle would look if a
paragraph about his bequest got into the
papers, and if he afterwards changed his mind,
as very likely he may do.’</p>

<p>Alec shook his head.</p>

<p>‘You don’t know my uncle, or you wouldn’t
talk of his changing his mind. But I’ll give
it to one of the fellows in the office to engross.’</p>

<p>‘It is much better to have things of that
sort copied in the office.’</p>

<p>With these words Beattie left the room, and
shortly afterwards he quietly went out.</p>

<p>When Alec finished the draft, he took it to
the managing clerk’s room, and as no one was
there he left it on the table as he had been
told to do. About five o’clock he wrote the
note to his uncle which Beattie had suggested
to him, and he told the clerk whose duty it
was to post the letters that Mr. Beattie would
give him the document that was to be sent
with the note. Having done this, Alec went
home.</p>

<p>The clerk found the draft of the will on
Mr. Beattie’s table. He was not quite sure
that his superior had seen it, for Mr. Beattie
was not in the office; but thinking he might
be held responsible if the letter were delayed,
he sent it off with the draft.</p>

<p>‘Do you know that your uncle had specially
desired that Alec Lindsay should draw his
will?’ were Beattie’s first words to his friend,
when he met him at the restaurant at four
o’clock.</p>

<p>‘No! Then the game is up!’</p>

<p>‘I’m not so sure of that. There is a
chance yet. It will depend on your skill and
coolness.’</p>

<p>‘On mine! I thought you said I was to
know nothing, and do nothing.’</p>

<p>‘And wait till the gold fell into your lap,
eh?’ sneered Beattie. ‘I shall have my own
share of trouble, and danger too, I can tell
you. You may believe me that if I could do
it all myself, I wouldn’t risk leaving it to
you.’</p>

<p>‘Then why don’t you do it?’</p>

<p>‘Do I live at No. 21, Claremont Gardens?’
asked Beattie savagely.</p>

<p>‘What do you want me to do?’ asked the
other.</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you when the time comes. But
why did you leave me to find out about this
minister, this Dr. Mackenzie? Why didn’t
you tell me about him?’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t think it was of any importance.’</p>

<p>‘Of no importance! I suppose he knows
all about your uncle’s intentions?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose he does.’</p>

<p>‘Anybody else?’</p>

<p>‘Not that I know of. I think not.’</p>

<p>‘Very well. Now listen to me. The
draft of the will will be sent to your uncle to-night,
with a request that it should be returned
by to-night’s post. It will be delivered
about eight or nine o’clock, I imagine. Your
business will be to keep this Dr. Mackenzie out
of the way. Take him to some meeting—anywhere,
in fact, but keep him out of the
house till your uncle has sent back the draft
to us. You understand?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I’ll see what I can do.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll do nothing of the kind. You’ll
<em>do it</em>.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know why you should speak in
that way to me, Beattie!’</p>

<p>‘Neither do I. All I know is, that no one
must see the draft except your uncle himself.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose I may read it, if he offers it to
me?’</p>

<p>‘No. Make some excuse, and don’t look
at it. I know all that is in it. And remember
this: the minister must not be
present on Thursday morning when the will
is executed. Can’t you make him go back to
Scotland?’</p>

<p>‘How can I manage that?’</p>

<p>‘Insult him. Turn him out of doors.’</p>

<p>‘Impossible.’</p>

<p>‘If you can’t manage it somehow, you
may say good-bye at once to your hundred
thousand pounds.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll do what I can; you may be sure of
that,’ said Semple sulkily.</p>

<p>‘And there’s one other thing. You
remember that paper of instructions I showed
you? We must get hold of that. I was
forced to give it to your cousin this morning,
that he might prepare the will from it. He
may leave it in his desk at the office: if so,
I’ll get possession of it. Or he may have
sent it to your uncle with the draft. Your
uncle may destroy it, or he may keep it, or
he may send it back to the office with the
draft. In the first case it will be all right.
If he sends it back to the office I shall be able
to lay my hands on it. But if he lays it by, <em>you</em>
must get it and bring it to me. It must not
be found among his papers after his death.’</p>

<p>‘I quite see the importance of that.
What I don’t see is, how I can take Dr.
Mackenzie out for the evening, and yet be in
my uncle’s room when the post comes in, to
see what he does with the paper.’</p>

<p>‘It is a difficulty; but you must try to
find a way out of it. Come now, Semple,
you have plenty of brains. Is there no one
in the house that will help you?’</p>

<p>‘No one—unless—I might try it,’ he
added, as if speaking to himself.</p>

<p>‘Is it of any use to try to get Alec
Lindsay on our side? If he would consent
simply to hold his tongue, it would be the
easiest thing possible.’</p>

<p>Semple shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p>‘You won’t get any help <em>there</em>,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘I thought as much. Well, I shall go
back to the office after dinner, and hunt
about for that paper of instructions. You
will be on the look-out for the evening
delivery, and ascertain what your uncle does
with it, if it reaches him. Keep the minister
out of the way; and come to my lodgings
to-morrow evening.’</p>

<p>‘At what hour?’</p>

<p>‘Any hour you like. But if I am not in,
wait for me, even if you should have to
wait all night. I must see you to-morrow
night.’</p>

<p>Semple promised that he would keep the
appointment, and, calling a cab, went straight
home. During the drive he racked his brains
to discover some method of inducing Dr.
Mackenzie to spend the evening elsewhere,
without being able to think of any practicable
plan.</p>

<p>Fortune, however, favoured him. In the
library he found an evening paper containing
a notice of a meeting in Exeter Hall which
he thought might prove an attraction to the
Presbyterian minister.</p>

<p>‘Did you see that the deputation of the
American Missionary Society is to be present
at the meeting in Exeter Hall?’ he asked
Dr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p>‘No; when is the meeting to be?’</p>

<p>‘To-night.’</p>

<p>‘Are you going to be there?’</p>

<p>‘I—I—don’t know. I was thinking of it.
Would you like to go?’ said Semple.</p>

<p>‘If you go, I should be happy to accompany
you. I am a stranger in London, and
I don’t care to go out alone at night.’</p>

<p>This struck Semple as odd. The minister
did not look like a man who would be afraid
to go out alone at night. However, he saw
that the only way to get Dr. Mackenzie
out of the way was to accompany him to
Exeter Hall; and accordingly he arranged to
do so.</p>

<p>The fact was that Dr. Mackenzie had
resolved to stay by Mr. Lindsay until the
will was executed, and be ready to fortify him
against the attacks which he supposed the
rich man’s relations would naturally make
upon his resolution to enrich the Free Church
at their expense. After skilful indirect
questioning he had satisfied himself that
neither Miss Lindsay nor Miss Mowbray
knew what the old man’s intentions were.
There remained the two nephews. As to
Alec, Mr. Lindsay himself had told his
spiritual adviser that he had confided in his
nephew, and had made him promise to attend
personally to the preparing of the will—a
proceeding which Dr. Mackenzie strongly
disapproved of, though he was too prudent to
say anything on the subject. He was quite
convinced that anything Alec could do to
prevent the bequest being made would be
done.</p>

<p>With regard to Semple, Dr. Mackenzie was
inclined to think, from the young man’s
manner towards himself, that he knew of his
uncle’s resolution; and the minister determined
to do what he could to keep Mr.
Lindsay and Semple apart for the short time
which had to elapse before the will could be
actually signed. For this reason he thought
it imprudent to absent himself for the whole
evening, and allow Semple to spend as much
time as he chose in his uncle’s room without
interruption. He had, therefore, managed to
make the young man accompany him on his
expedition to Exeter Hall.</p>

<p>But Semple had only performed half his
task when he had induced Dr. Mackenzie to
spend that evening where he would be beyond
his uncle’s reach. How was he to learn
what became of the paper of instructions in
Beattie’s handwriting, on the possession of
which his fellow-conspirator laid so much
stress? This could only be done by the help
of an ally; and there was only one possible
ally at his command.</p>

<p>He waylaid Laura Mowbray as she passed
downstairs to dinner, and drew her into a
little apartment that was used as a kind of
housekeeper’s-room.</p>

<p>‘I want to speak to you, Laura,’ he said;
‘and I have only a minute to spare. Are
you willing to do me a favour?’</p>

<p>‘That depends.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be foolish. Say yes or no. Don’t
you know that our whole future hangs on
what may happen during the next day or two?’</p>

<p>‘I suspected as much,’ answered Laura
quietly; ‘<em>your</em> future, you mean. I don’t
see how my future is concerned.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you? Are not our interests the
same?’</p>

<p>‘Not yet.’</p>

<p>‘But they will be. Now, I only want you
to do this. To-night, most likely by the last
delivery, a packet will come by post for my
uncle. It will contain a letter, a bulky document,
and another paper, a single sheet of
foolscap folded in four. The first two I don’t
care a straw about; but I want to know what
my uncle does with the thin paper, the sheet
of foolscap. Will you manage to find out
this for me?’</p>

<p>Laura hesitated. She had no idea of being
a tool in the hands of anyone; and she was
not sure that she should have allowed
Semple’s words as to the identity of his
interests and hers to pass unchallenged. Her
one desire was to discover whether Semple or
(as she hoped) Alec Lindsay was to be the
old man’s heir. But in a moment she had
decided to make herself useful, on the chance
of inducing Semple to tell her something.
As she wisely reflected, she could get the
information which he wanted without any
trouble, and either tell him what he wished to
know, or hold her tongue, as circumstances
might decide. She therefore whispered:</p>

<p>‘All right. Hush; I must go now. I
hear Miss Lindsay coming down.’</p>

<p>Miss Mowbray proved abundantly capable
of executing the commission which had been
intrusted to her.</p>

<p>She listened for the postman’s ring, and,
crossing the hall apparently by chance,
said to the servant who had answered the
door-bell:</p>

<p>‘Is that letter for Mr. Lindsay?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Then you may give it to me. I am going
to his room now.’</p>

<p>On reaching the old man’s bedroom, she
closed the door softly behind her, and going
up to him with swift, noiseless steps, she
said:</p>

<p>‘Dr. Mackenzie and James have gone out,
uncle; and Miss Lindsay is asleep; so I
have come to you for company. Do you
mind my sitting here half an hour, while
nurse goes to supper? Shall I disturb
you?’</p>

<p>‘No, child, no. I like to see you.’</p>

<p>‘I will sit by the fire, then, and be as still
as a mouse. Here is a letter that the postman
has just handed in. I took it from
Marks as I came upstairs.’</p>

</h3>
<h4>‘TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS!’<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was past eleven o’clock when Dr. Mackenzie
and his companion returned from
Exeter Hall; and after getting a little supper
in the dining-room together, they parted for
the night, Semple making sure that the
minister went straight to his bedroom before
he retired to his own. Hardly, however,
had Dr. Mackenzie been left alone, when a
tap came to his door. It was the nurse in
attendance on Mr. Lindsay, who had been
sent to tell the minister that the sick man
was anxious to see him before he went to
sleep.</p>

<p>‘I’ve got the draft of the will, Doctor,’
said Mr. Lindsay, as his guest entered the
room. ‘I thought you would maybe like to
see it; and as they want it sent back to-night,
I had to send for you.’</p>

<p>The minister professed himself to be very
willing to look over the draft, and seating
himself by the fire, he read it carefully through
twice.</p>

<p>‘It will be a disappointment to some of
them, I’m thinking,’ said the old man, as the
other at last laid down the paper.</p>

<p>‘But think of the good it will do,’ rejoined
the minister. ‘What better use can we make
of money, which is, after all, mere dross,
than devote it to the cause of Christ?’</p>

<p>‘Is the draft all right?’ asked Mr. Lindsay,
after a pause.</p>

<p>‘Yes; it seems to be in accordance with
your wishes.’</p>

<p>‘Just read it over to me, before it goes,’
said the old man; and the minister did so.</p>

<p>‘Now, I must get it posted to-night,’ said
Mr. Lindsay, when the reading was finished.</p>

<p>‘I’ll post it myself,’ said Dr. Mackenzie,
promptly. ‘There’s a pillar-box at the
corner. It won’t take me a minute.’</p>

<p>This offer was gratefully accepted. The
minister let himself quietly out of the house,
leaving the street-door ajar while he went to
the pillar-box, which was only a few yards
off; and when he returned he went back to
his own room, without making noise enough
to wake anyone in the house.</p>

<p>It had not been without some reluctance
that Laura Mowbray had consented to play
the spy for James Semple. Not that she
was conscious of any humiliation in the matter—she
rather enjoyed the excitement of it—but
she felt that in yielding to his wishes she
had made the tie between them stronger than
was perhaps altogether prudent. In their
last interview Semple had assumed that he
was her accepted lover, and she knew that he
had grounds for so doing. So long ago as
the summer when they had been together at
Loch Long, she perceived that he, as well as
Alec Lindsay, was in love with her, although
Alec’s passion found vent in words while his
cousin’s did not. When Semple did declare
himself, some time afterwards, she had given
him much the same answer as she had given
to Alec. But lately he had renewed his
pleading, and meeting with a very weak
resistance, he had assumed that he was, or
very soon would be, successful. Of late,
however, he had had no time for love-making.</p>

<p>Laura had produced in his mind exactly
the impression she had intended. She did
not wish to accept his offer just then, but
neither did she wish to send him away. Her
heart (such as it was) was with Alec; but
then she could not bring herself to marry a
poor man; and Alec had thrown away his
chances of ingratiating himself with his uncle
so persistently, that she had very little hope
that he would find himself rich after his uncle’s
death. Semple, she felt sure, would be the
heir, but she had no idea of pledging herself
irrevocably till the event had declared itself.</p>

<p>On the morning after she had paid her
visit to Mr. Lindsay’s bedroom in accordance
with her lover’s directions, Miss Mowbray
took good care to be early in the breakfast-room.
She anticipated that Semple would
take that opportunity of having an interview
with her, and she was not disappointed.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ he said eagerly, as soon as he
entered the room, without waiting to bid her
good-morning, ‘did my uncle get the letter
last night?’</p>

<p>‘What would you give to know?’ returned
the girl, with a saucy air.</p>

<p>A coarse expression sprang to the young
man’s lips, but he had sense enough to
restrain it.</p>

<p>‘Don’t trifle with me,’ he said.</p>

<p>Laura was struck by the anxious, haggard
look on his face, as well as by the tone of
his voice.</p>

<p>‘Why are you so anxious about that letter?’
she asked.</p>

<p>‘Don’t bother me with questions now. I’ll
tell you all by-and-by, if you wish it. Did
he get the letter?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I was in his room when he opened it.’</p>

<p>‘Good.’</p>

<p>‘And I saw him take out the two papers
you described.’</p>

<p>‘Yes? Do be quick; some one will be
coming down.’</p>

<p>‘He put the large one back into the envelope,
and put it under his pillow.’</p>

<p>‘And the thin one?’</p>

<p>‘He put it into the little desk which stands
on the table at the foot of his bed.’</p>

<p>‘You saw him do that?’</p>

<p>‘I did. He asked me to hand him the
desk; he opened it, and put the paper in.’</p>

<p>‘Did he lock the desk afterwards?’ asked
Semple, dropping his voice.</p>

<p>‘Yes, he did.’</p>

<p>There was a minute’s pause.</p>

<p>‘What did he do with the key?’ was the
next question.</p>

<p>‘The key was on a bunch. He put it
back on the table—the little one, close to his
hand.’</p>

<p>‘I must get those keys,’ said Semple.</p>

<p>‘Not through me,’ said Laura, growing
pale as she spoke. ‘I’ll have nothing to do
with taking away any papers, or burning
them, or anything of that sort.’</p>

<p>The girl was thoroughly frightened, and
Semple saw that it was necessary to reassure
her.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be foolish,’ he said. ‘Who wants
to steal anything? I want to see that paper,
and I must see it.’</p>

<p>‘Well; I can’t help you.’</p>

<p>‘Look here, Laura, you don’t understand.
I’m trying to counteract the schemes of that
villain, Dr. Mackenzie. If I succeed, I shall
have two hundred thousand pounds under my
uncle’s will.’</p>

<p>‘Two hundred thousand pounds!’</p>

<p>‘Yes; or between a hundred and fifty and
two hundred thousand, at any rate. We
shall be able to go to Italy: all round the
world, if we like. Eight or ten thousand a
year, Laura; think of that! You see it’s
worth taking a little trouble for. Can’t you
get the desk and the bunch of keys out of the
room, just for five minutes?’</p>

<p>‘Impossible,’ said Laura firmly. ‘I have
no idea where your uncle generally keeps his
keys; very likely in some drawer that is
locked up. You needn’t think of it.’</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>‘There is one way,’ said Laura slowly.</p>

<p>‘Yes; what way?’</p>

<p>‘Though I can’t get the keys, I might get
the desk out of the room. Or you might do
it yourself. You see, the desk stands on the
table at the foot of the bed, out of your
uncle’s sight. It is not heavy, quite a small
thing, and easy to move. You have only to
find out when your uncle is asleep, and
quietly carry the desk out of the room. The
nurse would never dream of interfering with
you. Of course, you would have to bring it
back soon, in case your uncle should ask for it.’</p>

<p>‘Of what use would the desk be, without
the key?’</p>

<p>Laura smiled contemptuously, but suddenly
she grew grave.</p>

<p>‘I have said quite enough,’ her face said
pretty plainly.</p>

<p>‘Could you get me the desk, or let me
know when it would be safe to take it?’ was
Semple’s next question, spoken almost in a
whisper. ‘Think how much may depend on
it,’ he added.</p>

<p>‘Why should so much depend on it?’</p>

<p>‘I can hardly tell you.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ said Laura hastily. ‘It
doesn’t matter to me.’</p>

<p>She saw it might be safer not to know too
much.</p>

<p>‘Will you do it then?’</p>

<p>‘I won’t touch the desk, if you mean that,’
said Laura. ‘Mr. Lindsay generally takes a
nap about four in the afternoon. I could
<span class="lock">easily——’</span></p>

<p>At that moment Aunt Jean made her appearance,
followed by a servant with a tray,
and the conference was at an end.</p>

<p>In the course of the day, Semple managed
to take the desk out of his uncle’s room while
the old man was asleep; and he had no great
difficulty in opening it by means of a picklock,
which he had borrowed. This done, he
found and burned the paper of instructions.</p>

</h3>
<h4>DAVID MACGOWAN GETS INTO TROUBLE.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing that caught Alec Lindsay’s
eye when he went down to the office next
morning was the draft of his uncle’s will.
No corrections had been made in it; no suggestions
had been written in the margin; and
assuming that the managing clerk had looked
over it on the preceding evening, he was
about to send it out to the law-stationer’s,
when he remembered Beattie’s hint that it
would be more prudent to have it ‘engrossed’
in the office.</p>

<p>Taking the paper in his hand, he went into
the ‘outer office,’ where four clerks sat whose
duty it was to do the more mechanical part
of the work of the conveyancing department.</p>

<p>‘Where’s Hobson?’ asked Alec.</p>

<p>‘He and Graves are out, comparing an
abstract,’ said one of the clerks, whose name
was Hill. ‘Mr. Beattie told them yesterday
they were to go the first thing this morning.’</p>

<p>‘Then you had better leave off what you
are doing, Hill, and engross this will.’</p>

<p>‘Very sorry, sir, but Mr. Beattie has given
me this settlement and this mortgage to do,’
pointing to the papers and parchments as he
spoke; ‘and he particularly told me not to
leave them till I had finished them.’</p>

<p>MacGowan’s services were available; but
Alec would have preferred to entrust the draft
to one of the other clerks.</p>

<p>‘When will Hobson and Graves be back?’
he asked.</p>

<p>‘Not until late, I expect,’ answered Hill;
‘they have gone into the country—to St.
Albans.’</p>

<p>It was more than probable that the two
absent clerks would contrive to make a day of
it at St. Albans, so Alec turned to MacGowan
and asked if he were busy.</p>

<p>He was not.</p>

<p>‘I wish you would engross this, then,’ said
Alec, giving him the draft; ‘and see you
hold your tongue about it when you go outside,’
he added in a lower tone.</p>

<p>MacGowan promised obedience with more
fervour than was necessary, and Alec returned
to his own room.</p>

<p>Left to himself, MacGowan laid the draft
before him and measured its length with a
practised eye. There was abundance of time
for him to finish engrossing it before the
luncheon-hour. He was glad of this, for it
was pay-day, and he knew by experience that
it was very doubtful if he would be back at
his desk in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Every month, as pay-day came round, he
made a resolution that he would dine sparely,
and drink nothing but water, and return at
the proper hour. But the resolution had
been so constantly broken, that he had no
faith in his own power to keep it, and always
took care, on such occasions, to leave matters
so that his absence might attract as little
attention as possible. More than once he
had been nearly dismissed for this very
offence, but his fellow-clerks were generally
good-natured enough to invent excuses for
him; and once, as we have seen, Alec had
stood his friend.</p>

<p>One o’clock struck, and the will was finished.
MacGowan left his seat and went to the
cashier’s room to receive the money that was
due to him. That official, however, had
gone out, and he returned discontentedly to
his place.</p>

<p>It happened that he and his fellow-clerk
Hill were not on very good terms with each
other just then, so, by way of putting off
the time until the cashier’s return, he took
the will and the draft from which he had
copied it to Alec Lindsay, and got him to go
through the process of ‘examining’ the two
documents along with him—one reading the
engrossed will aloud, while the other read the
draft—on the plea that Hill was too busy to
do it.</p>

<p>As he returned to the outer office, he met
the managing clerk.</p>

<p>‘Have you engrossed a will for Mr. Lindsay
this morning?’ asked Mr. Beattie.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir; just finished it.’</p>

<p>‘If you bring it to my room, I will examine
it with you. I don’t want Hill to be taken
from what he is doing.’</p>

<p>This was an unusual kind offer for Mr.
Beattie to make; but MacGowan, of course,
answered:</p>

<p>‘Mr. Lindsay has examined it with me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very good,’ said Beattie, as he passed
out of the office.</p>

<p>MacGowan waited impatiently until about
two o’clock, when the cashier made his
appearance. By that time he was very
hungry, and thirsty as well.</p>

<p>‘I want my salary, if you please,’ said he,
as soon as the cashier was seated at his
desk.</p>

<p>‘It’s early in the day, MacGowan,’ said
the cashier. ‘Better let me give you only a
shilling or two now. If you take it all, the
chances are you won’t make your appearance
again to-day, and you know what the consequence
of that must be, sooner or later.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll be back at three, Mr. Carter, never
fear,’ said the clerk.</p>

<p>‘You had better not take it all at present.’</p>

<p>‘I must take it all, sooner or later,’
answered MacGowan in a hard, stubborn
voice; ‘and little enough it is. Give it to
me, Mr. Carter.’</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards MacGowan was
hurrying along in the direction of a large
tavern near the office, where he usually dined
on high days. If he had not been so intent
upon getting there, he would have noticed
Mr. William Beattie walking slowly along, on
the other side of the street.</p>

<p>Beattie, who knew the clerk’s habits perfectly
well, was, in fact, waiting for him. As
soon as MacGowan entered the tavern,
Beattie, with a smile on his thin lips, returned
to the office. Everything had happened
exactly as he had foreseen that it
would happen.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon Alec
Lindsay made his appearance in the managing
clerk’s room, and asked him if he would
attend at his uncle’s on the following morning,
to superintend the signing of the will.</p>

<p>‘Indeed I can’t. I have to be in the Vice-Chancellor’s
room by ten, and I shall probably
be out all the morning. Why don’t you
do it yourself?’</p>

<p>‘Because my name is mentioned in the
will.’</p>

<p>‘What does that matter? You needn’t
witness it. Get two of the servants to do
that.’</p>

<p>‘But I have never done anything of the
kind before.’</p>

<p>‘Why, a child might do it. Ask Mr.
Hatchett to go, if you like, but don’t bother
me any more, there’s a good fellow. I’m
terribly busy.’</p>

<p>Alec knew that Mr. Hatchett would never
dream of attending personally at so simple a
matter as the execution of a will, so he made
up his mind to go himself.</p>

<p>About five o’clock that afternoon Mr.
Beattie went into the outer office, and inquired
for MacGowan. Of course he was not
there—had not been seen for the last three
hours. Beattie struck his fist angrily on the
desk before him, and went straight to Mr.
Hatchett’s room.</p>

<p>Graves (who had just returned from St.
Albans) looked at Hill and grinned.</p>

<p>‘’E’ll ’ave it this time, to a dead certainty,’
said Mr. Hill.</p>

<p>‘Right you are, Mr. ’Ill,’ said Mr. Graves.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid we can’t afford to keep that
fellow MacGowan any longer,’ said Beattie to
Mr. Hatchett. ‘He has not been here since
three o’clock—drinking, I suppose. It is the
same thing every pay-day, and on other occasions
too—whenever he has money, in fact.’</p>

<p>‘Dismiss him, then, and advertise for
another clerk,’ said the solicitor, hardly
troubling himself to look up from the paper
he was reading.</p>

<p>‘I think in that case you had better write
the note, Mr. Hatchett. He will understand
then that the decision is your own.’</p>

<p>Mr. Hatchett wrote a dozen words on a
sheet of paper, and handed it to his subordinate.</p>

<p>‘Get it copied in the letter-book, and send
it to his lodgings,’ he said, turning back to his
work.</p>

<p>Mr. David MacGowan was troubled by no
fears of the fate which had been prepared for
him. About eight o’clock that evening he
was sitting in the smoking-room of ‘The
Alexandra,’ with a glass of punch before
him, applauding, in a loud, half-tipsy tone, a
song which had just been finished. Care he
had cast to the winds. He was not quite
drunk, though he was far from sober; and,
after his besotted fashion, he was enjoying
himself thoroughly. Suddenly his face grew
pale, and his tongue refused to speak the
words on his lips, for there, calmly surveying
the company from the doorway, stood—Mr.
William Beattie.</p>

<p>A vague sense of alarm filled MacGowan’s
mind; but he was too tipsy to speculate on
the reason which the respectable Mr. Beattie
might have for coming to such a place.</p>

<p>In another moment Beattie had recognised
him, and walked straight up to him.</p>

<p>‘Will you step outside for a moment, Mr.
MacGowan? I wish to speak with you,’ said
he.</p>

<p>‘Better say’t here, whatever it is,’ answered
the clerk, stringing his words together as he
spoke.</p>

<p>‘Come upstairs for a minute,’ was Beattie’s
answer, laying his hand on the other’s arm,
and looking straight into his eyes.</p>

<p>MacGowan recognised the presence of a
stronger will; he staggered to his feet and
allowed Beattie to lead him out of the
room.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what he was doing, the
clerk followed Beattie to a private room which
the latter had already engaged. On the
table lay two or three sheets of foolscap, an
inkstand and pens, while a decanter and some
glasses stood on a small side-table.</p>

<p>‘Sit down, MacGowan; you have been enjoying
yourself, I see.’</p>

<p>‘Just for once in a while, Mr. Beattie,’ said
the other, with tipsy gravity. ‘<i lang="la">Dulce est
desipere—in—loco</i>, ye ken.’</p>

<p>‘Exactly; and I’m sorry to interrupt you;
but I want to know whether you engrossed a
will this afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure I don’t know. Dare say I did.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it appears you have made a blunder
in it. I can’t stop to explain it. It wasn’t
your fault really; and it won’t make any
difference if you will just copy it over again.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t—not just now; I’ll do it in the
morning;’ and Mr. MacGowan seemed on the
point of dropping off to sleep.</p>

<p>Beattie roused him with a slap on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>‘Come, come,’ he cried, ‘you’re not too
tipsy to <span class="lock">write——’</span></p>

<p>‘Tipsy? Who’s tipsy? I’m not tipsy,’
interrupted the other.</p>

<p>‘All right, then. Come along. See; I’ve
ruled a sheet of paper; and I’ll read the draft
for you, so that you can make no mistake.’</p>

<p>MacGowan suffered himself to be dragged
to the table; and, once there, his mechanical
power of copying asserted itself. Steadily
his pen moved over the paper, while Beattie
looked over the writer’s shoulder, reading
every word as it was written, to make sure
that no blunder was committed.</p>

<p>Before ten o’clock the task was ended. The
document was folded, endorsed in the orthodox
manner, and safely lodged in Mr. Beattie’s
pocket.</p>

<p>‘You’ll stand a bottle of champagne, Mr.
Beattie?’ said the clerk, throwing himself back
in his chair.</p>

<p>‘Certainly; but I’d advise you to stick to
whisky. It’s the healthier of the two,’ said
Beattie, slipping half a sovereign into the
other’s hand. ‘Hadn’t you better go home
now?’ he added, feeling pretty certain that
the advice would not be acted upon.</p>

<p>‘In a wee while, Mr. Beattie. I’ll drink
your very good health in the first place. I
look upon that as a duty. Good-night, sir;
good-night. You’re a gentleman, sir. And,
look here, I’ll be at old Hatchett’s as usual
to-morrow, and you’ll say nothing about seeing
me here? It’s a low place, Mr. Beattie;
I’m quite aware of that—a place I very
seldom come to.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly not. It is not my business to
carry tales.’</p>

<p>‘And, I say, how did you know I was
here?’ asked MacGowan suddenly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I thought it likely.’</p>

<p>‘And about that will——’ began MacGowan;
and he stopped, trying to recollect
what the other had said about it.</p>

<p>‘Oh, never mind; it’s all right. I’m
afraid I must be off now,’ said Beattie.</p>

<p>‘All right. Then, good-night, Mr. Beattie,
good-night.’</p>

<p>And so the managing clerk made his escape,
while poor MacGowan returned to the room
from which he had been summoned.</p>

<h4>THE SIGNING OF THE WILL.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent">‘I <span class="smcap">have</span> more right to be here, sir, than a
stranger.’ These were the words, uttered by
James Semple in a voice of suppressed indignation,
which Alec Lindsay heard as he entered
his uncle’s bedroom next day. He had come
to superintend the execution of Mr. Lindsay’s
will, bringing the document with him
ready for signature.</p>

<p>The old man was sitting up in bed, a table
with writing materials beside him. Near the
fireplace stood Dr. Mackenzie, a look of firm
resolve on his face. At the foot of the bed
stood Semple, who seemed to be bitterly protesting
against being excluded from the room.</p>

<p>‘Just consider, uncle!’ he continued; ‘I
have served you for the last ten years, and
served you faithfully. What have I done, to
be treated like a stranger now? Alec is to
make your will; I don’t complain of that.
Don’t think for a moment I am jealous of him.
But why am I to be thrust out, while one who
is no member of the family is admitted?’</p>

<p>The old man glanced helplessly at Dr.
Mackenzie as if asking for advice. But the
minister held his peace.</p>

<p>‘I think you might let my cousin stay,
uncle,’ said Alec. ‘It is perhaps only fair
that he should know your intentions.’</p>

<p>‘Ay; so let it be,’ said Mr. Lindsay, in a
feeble tone. ‘The whole world will know
soon enough. But don’t blame me, lads,
after I am gone, I did it for the best. God
knows, I did it for the best.’</p>

<p>And Semple, having received permission
to stay in the room, walked over to the
window.</p>

<p>‘We must get two witnesses,’ said Alec,
drawing the will from its envelope. ‘Marks
and the cook will do.’</p>

<p>‘The will had better be read first,’ put in
Dr. Mackenzie. ‘There’s no need for the
servants knowing its contents.’</p>

<p>‘True,’ said Mr. Lindsay; and Alec, standing
at the old man’s bedside, began to read in
a clear firm tone.</p>

<p>He had nearly finished his task, when he
noticed that Semple (who was still standing
by the window) was pulling down the
blind.</p>

<p>‘Don’t do that, James; I have hardly light
enough as it is,’ said Alec.</p>

<p>‘I thought the light was in my uncle’s
eyes,’ answered Semple, without pulling the
blind up again.</p>

<p>‘It was very well as it was; pull up the
blind,’ said the old man fretfully.</p>

<p>Semple did as he was told, and Alec went
on reading.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards a hansom drove up to
the door, and there was a loud ring at the door-bell.
James Semple slowly moved away from
the window, and left the room.</p>

<p>‘You can ring for Marks and Mrs. Jackson
now, Alec,’ said Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>He did so; but Marks, who answered the
bell, told Alec that Mr. Beattie had called to
see him on very important business.</p>

<p>‘I wonder what it can be,’ said Alec to
himself. ‘I will be back in a minute or two,
uncle,’ he said, as he laid the will which he
had just read on the table by his uncle’s bed,
and ran downstairs.</p>

<p>‘Lindsay,’ began Mr. Beattie, as soon as
Alec made his appearance, ‘you saw Marchand,
I think, one day about a month ago, about
the Walters’ case?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Do you remember what passed between
you?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing very important. I told you of it
at the time;’ and Alec detailed the conversation
which had taken place.</p>

<p>‘Very good,’ said Beattie. ‘Now I want
you to make an affidavit of what passed, to
be used at the motion which comes on for hearing
to-day.’</p>

<p>‘But you can’t use an affidavit filed to-day.’</p>

<p>‘We can try; and I think we shall
manage it. Sit down, like a good fellow,
and jot down what you remember of the conversation.
I’ve brought draft-paper with me.’</p>

<p>‘All right; but wait until I’ve seen my
uncle sign his will, and then I’ll go down to
the Law Courts with you.’</p>

<p>‘You needn’t come just yet, for I have to
get a copy made, of course. If you will only
sit down and put the heads of it in writing, it
won’t take you ten minutes; and then, while
you are getting the will signed, I will drive
down to the Law Courts, and get it copied and
ready for you to sign when you arrive there.
The fact is,’ added Beattie, ‘I ought to have
asked you to do this yesterday, but I was so
busy with other matters that it escaped me.’</p>

<p>‘Very well; I’ll just go and tell my uncle
that I am detained for a few minutes.’</p>

<p>‘It isn’t necessary,’ answered Beattie with
some anxiety in his tone. ‘The thing would
be done almost before you could get upstairs.
I do wish you would do it at once; for that
motion may come on at any time after twelve,
and if it is lost for want of this affidavit, it
will be my fault.’</p>

<p>Beattie’s request was not unreasonable, so,
sending a message to Mr. Lindsay to explain
the delay, Alec began hastily to jot down the
substance of the affidavit he was about to
make, while Beattie paced quietly but restlessly
about the room.</p>

<p>As soon as Alec had joined his fellow-clerk
in the library, James Semple went to the
drawing-room, which at that hour of the day
was always empty. On this occasion, however,
Laura Mowbray was there, waiting for
him.</p>

<p>‘Now’s the time, Laura,’ he cried, in an
excited tone, though he spoke under his
breath. ‘Alec is safe in the library, and the
will is lying on the bed, probably; or at any
rate it is somewhere in the bedroom. You
have only to whisper to uncle that the
solicitor’s managing clerk, Mr. Beattie, wants
to look over the will to see that it is all right,
and he will let you take it at once.’</p>

<p>‘But, James, I don’t like doing it. Can’t
you think of any other way of getting a
sight of it?’</p>

<p>‘No, I can’t.’</p>

<p>‘Why can’t you go yourself, and tell my
uncle this?’</p>

<p>‘Of course he would suspect that I wished
to read it.’</p>

<p>‘And is it really necessary that you should
see it?’</p>

<p>‘Didn’t I tell you this morning, Laura,
that unless I can get a sight of it, I shall
never see a penny of that two hundred
thousand pounds?’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because if the will is not in my favour, I
will press my uncle to revoke it, after that
minister has gone. But unless you want to
ruin me, you will go now. Soon Alec will be
back from the library, and then it will be too
late.’</p>

<p>Still Laura was not satisfied.</p>

<p>‘Couldn’t you manage to be in the room
when the will is read over to your uncle,
before he signs it?’</p>

<p>‘No, no; that has been done already.
That is—it won’t be done. Now do go,
Laura, unless you mean to make us poor
all our lives.’</p>

<p>A smile that was half-contemptuous passed
over Laura Mowbray’s pretty face, as she
glided away from the drawing-room. She
certainly did not intend to be poor all her life
in the company of Mr. James Semple.</p>

<p>In less than a minute she had reached Mr.
Lindsay’s room. Dr. Mackenzie was still
there, standing with his back to the room,
looking out of the window. Laura glided up
to the bed and spoke some words in a tone so
low that the old man could not catch them.
He knew, however, that the visitor downstairs
was Messrs. Hatchett’s managing clerk, so
that when Laura lifted the unsigned will lying
beside him, he merely said, ‘Do they want to
see it?’ at which Laura nodded, and took
it away. The minister saw that she had
come and gone, but he ascribed no importance
to what passed. He did not notice, indeed,
that the will had been removed.</p>

<p>Laura carried it to the drawing-room,
where Semple was impatiently waiting for
her. Almost snatching the paper from her
hand, he said in a whisper, ‘Stand just outside
the door and listen, in case the library door
should open,’ and took the will to one of the
windows at the farther end of the room,
to read it. Laura obeyed so far as to stand
in the doorway, from which position she
could hear anyone opening the door of the
library, on the floor below.</p>

<p>Semple’s scrutiny of the will did not last
long. Very soon he returned to Laura, with
satisfaction in his face and bearing.</p>

<p>‘All right,’ he exclaimed. ‘Now, all you
have to do is to put it back again. Here,’ he
added, picking up an open newspaper which
looked as if it had been brought there on
purpose, ‘slip the will under this, and lay
them both on the table. When Alec comes
back he will remember that he left the will on
the table; he will lift the newspaper and find
it there; and uncle will never notice, if you
attract his attention, that Alec did not bring
it back into the room himself.’</p>

<p>Laura admired and rather wondered at
these elaborate instructions for carrying out
what she thought was a very simple ruse.
But she had no opportunity of putting them
in practice. As she ascended the last flight
of stairs, Alec came bounding up, three steps
at a time, and overtook her as she reached
the landing.</p>

<p>‘Why, Laura, what have you got there?’
he asked in surprise, taking the will from her
unresisting hand.</p>

<p>The two stood looking at each other for a
moment, without speaking.</p>

<p>‘What were you doing with this?’ asked
Alec.</p>

<p>Laura had made up her mind. She would
not confess to Alec that she had been acting
under Semple’s directions. It would have
been equivalent to making that definite choice
between the two which she had resolved not
to make until it was known what share of his
uncle’s property Alec was to have.</p>

<p>‘Oh! don’t tell my uncle,’ she said
rapidly, speaking almost in a whisper. ‘I
wanted to know what was in it.’</p>

<p>‘You wanted to know whether my uncle
was going to leave you anything?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; and I pretended to him that you
and the other clerk from your office wanted
to see it. But I have not looked at it. I
have not read a line of it! Indeed I have
not!’ and Laura burst into tears.</p>

<p>Alec did not speak. It did not seem a
very serious matter, but he was pained to
think that the girl he loved should have done
such a thing.</p>

<p>‘Only promise me that you won’t speak of
it!’ she cried, with clasped hands, her eyes
swimming in tears.</p>

<p>Alec reflected for a moment. He could
not see that there was any duty cast upon
him to mention Laura’s indiscretion to his
uncle. Even if she had peeped into the will,
no harm could have been done. He gave the
required promise, and turned away, going into
his uncle’s room, while Laura, unwilling to
go downstairs and meet Semple, whom at
this moment she positively hated, ran up to
her own room.</p>

<p>‘What a fool I was to listen to him!’ she
exclaimed aloud, when she had shut the door.
‘But, after all, it doesn’t very much matter,’
she said to herself, a moment afterwards.
‘Alec thinks it was only my own curiosity
that made me meddle with the will; and
he won’t tell upon me, that’s certain. I
wonder whether Mr. Lindsay has left me
anything! I suppose James never looked;
he was only anxious to find out what he was
to have for himself. And Alec never would
tell me. I wonder what Alec himself will
get. I shouldn’t wonder if he gets as much
us James. Oh! I wish he had not caught
me just now!’</p>

<p>And, renewing her resolution to wait until
the will was read before she committed herself
irretrievably to either of the two young men,
Laura proceeded to wash away the traces of
tears from her face.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Beattie had left the house, and
Alec had summoned Marks and Mrs. Jackson,
the cook, to their master’s room.</p>

<p>The will was duly signed and witnessed,
Dr. Mackenzie looking on with a grave face;
and when all the formalities had been gone
through, Mr. Lindsay put the document in its
envelope, sealed it carefully with his own
hand, and gave it to Alec.</p>

<p>‘Give it to Mr. Hatchett, my lad,’ he
said. ‘He should have been here to-day
himsel’—but it doesn’t matter. Tell him to
lock it up in his safe till—till it’s wanted.
And now I think I’ll try and get a little sleep,
for I feel tired.’</p>

<p>Alec took the will to Mr. Hatchett, and
saw it put away in his safe, before going
down to the law courts.</p>

<p>As for Dr. Mackenzie, after a final interview
with Mr. Lindsay he took his leave, and
returned to Glasgow by the night mail.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-five">XXV.</abbr><br>
</h3>
<h4>MR. WILLIAM BEATTIE ACTS LIKE A CHRISTIAN.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> leaving Mr. Lindsay’s house, Mr.
Beattie went first of all to the Law Courts in
the Strand. But he did not remain there long.
He took the draft affidavit to a law stationer’s,
and then, leaving instructions for Alec with
the junior clerk who had been waiting in the
Judge’s chambers, he left the case Walter v.
Walter to take care of itself, called a hansom,
and told the cabman to drive to King’s Cross.
Arrived there, he dismissed the cab, and
plunged into a nest of squalid, airless streets,
not far from the railway terminus.</p>

<p>After some difficulty, he found the one he
was in quest of—Milton Street—and then a
further search ensued for No. 76. When
this, too, was found, he made some further
inquiries, and, obeying the directions he
obtained, made his way to the top of the
house, and knocked with his umbrella at a
rickety door.</p>

<p>A faint voice bade him enter, and there,
sitting by the fireplace, was the man he
sought. Mr. David MacGowan did not
present an attractive appearance. Unwashed,
unshaven, his shabby clothes in complete
disorder, his hair undressed, his eyes bloodshot,
his hand trembling, he certainly looked
a miserable object. The fire, which had
been lighted with damp wood under an overburdening
mass of coal-dust and cinders, was
slowly going out, but MacGowan had not
sufficient energy to try to make it burn. His
miserable breakfast stood untasted on the
table, upon which lay an open letter. When
he saw who his visitor was, he did not say a
word, but turned his face to the smouldering
fire, and gazed at it moodily.</p>

<p>Beattie, without waiting for an invitation,
sat down opposite him, and began to ask him
where he had put certain papers which had
been in his charge, and some other questions
of a like nature. MacGowan sullenly
answered him, without removing his eyes from
the fire.</p>

<p>‘When I looked over the letter-book this
morning,’ said Beattie, when these matters
had been discussed, ‘I was sorry to see a
letter of Mr. Hatchett’s telling you that you
need not come back again.’</p>

<p>‘Ay! I dare say ye ken a’ aboot it,’ said
the other.</p>

<p>‘If you mean that it was my doing, you
are quite mistaken,’ said Beattie hastily.
‘Mr. Hatchett decided upon it himself; and
really, you know, MacGowan, you can’t be
very much surprised at it.’</p>

<p>MacGowan gave an indifferent kind of
sigh, as much as to say that it mattered little
from whose hand the blow had fallen, and
that he did not very much care.</p>

<p>‘Will they give me a character?’ he asked
suddenly, turning his eyes for the first time
on his visitor.</p>

<p>Beattie shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>‘You might write me one yoursel’,’ suggested
the ex-clerk.</p>

<p>Beattie shook his head still more
decidedly.</p>

<p>‘Unless I used the firm’s name, it would
be of no use,’ said he; ‘and if I did, it
might be as much as my place is worth.’</p>

<p>The gleam of hope died out in MacGowan’s
watery eyes, and he turned once more to
contemplate the dying fire.</p>

<p>‘What are you thinking of doing?’ asked
Beattie after a pause.</p>

<p>‘Nothing.’</p>

<p>‘But you must do something, or starve.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t care.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, nonsense, man! I’ll tell you what
you ought to do—emigrate! In a new
country, where there are fewer public-houses
than there are in London, and no temptations
to spend money, you might make a fresh
start, and end by becoming a rich man.’</p>

<p>MacGowan made no answer.</p>

<p>‘Come, now; wouldn’t it be the most
sensible thing to do?’</p>

<p>‘May be; but how can I go abroad? I
haven’t enough to pay fare to Aberdeen, let
alone America.’</p>

<p>‘Get your friends to lend you enough to
pay your passage-money, and to start with.’</p>

<p>MacGowan gave a scornful laugh.</p>

<p>‘Where may they be, I wonder?’ said he.</p>

<p>‘Well, MacGowan,’ said Beattie, speaking
very slowly and deliberately, ‘you know we
Scots should help one another in a difficulty;
and if I thought you would pay me back
again, I wouldn’t mind giving you the means
of making a fresh start.’</p>

<p>‘Would you really, man?’ exclaimed
MacGowan, looking up eagerly in Beattie’s
face.</p>

<p>‘I would, if I thought you would really
make an effort to repay me.’</p>

<p>‘I would pay you back, as sure’s death,’
said MacGowan earnestly.</p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t advise any young man to go to
America,’ said Beattie. ‘There are more
men there than there is work for. Australia—Western
Australia—that’s the place for a
young fellow of talent and energy.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a long way off,’ said MacGowan
doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘Not in these days of big steamers,’ said
Beattie in a cheerful tone, taking a newspaper
from his pocket as he spoke. ‘See here,
man,’ he added, running his eye over the
shipping advertisements, ‘here’s your chance:
“Steam to Australia. The <i>Tasmania</i>. Third-class
passage, £13. Superior accommodation.”
Sails to-morrow. What do you say
to that?’</p>

<p>‘It would be cheaper to go to the States,’
said MacGowan, reaching out his hand for the
paper.</p>

<p>‘But you would have no chance in the
States,’ answered Beattie. ‘It would be
throwing away money to go there.’</p>

<p>‘I would want an outfit,’ said MacGowan.</p>

<p>‘Not very much. I’m told you can buy
most things as cheaply out there as in this
country. If you like to go to Western
Australia, which is the country I recommend,
decidedly, I’ll lend you enough for the
passage-money and some clothes, and twenty
pounds to start with. What do you say to
that?’</p>

<p>MacGowan was astonished.</p>

<p>‘Man, Beattie, you’re acting like a Christian,’
he said solemnly, as he stretched out
his hand.</p>

<p>Then he began to weep.</p>

<p>Beattie took the outstretched hand, though
it was not a very clean one, and shook it.</p>

<p>‘Look here, now,’ said he, ‘this is what
you’ll do. Make yourself as smart as you
can, and meet me at the King’s Cross Metropolitan
Station in an hour’s time. I will
have half the money—twenty pounds—ready
for you then. Thirteen of that will be
for your passage-money, and the rest for
clothes. Go to the owners’ office in Fenchurch
Street, and take your ticket this
afternoon. Bring it to my lodgings any time
this evening, and I’ll see you off to-morrow
afternoon, and give you the other twenty
pounds. Will that suit you?’</p>

<p>‘Couldn’t be better, Mr. Beattie; couldn’t
be better. But if the same firm should have
a boat for Canada, for <span class="lock">example——’</span></p>

<p>‘I thought we had settled that,’ said
Beattie quietly. ‘Why should I throw away
my money in helping you to emigrate to a
country where I feel convinced you would
starve?’</p>

<p>Whereupon MacGowan protested his perfect
readiness to go to Australia, and Mr.
Beattie departed.</p>

<p>Once or twice during the interview Beattie
had been tempted to make distant references
to what had passed at the tavern the preceding
night, with a view to ascertaining how much
or how little of it MacGowan remembered.
But he wisely refrained from doing so. The
clerk seemed to have forgotten the piece of
extra work which Beattie had persuaded him
to do, or, if he remembered it, he apparently
thought it was not worth alluding to. To
refer to it now, Beattie considered, might
only have the effect of refreshing his memory,
whereas, if nothing happened to recall the
incident which had taken place when he was
half tipsy, it would probably fade altogether
from his recollection.</p>

<p>An hour later, MacGowan presented himself
at the rendezvous at King’s Cross. He
had evidently made a great effort to look
respectable; but he still had the appearance
of a man who was just recovering from a
debauch. Beattie did not detain him long.</p>

<p>‘Here’s the money,’ he said, slipping a roll
of sovereigns into his hand, ‘and you’ll repay
me out of the first money you can conveniently
spare.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll work my fingers to the bone; I’ll
live on bread and water——’ began MacGowan.</p>

<p>‘I don’t ask you to do that,’ said Beattie
quietly, as a satirical smile crossed his face.
‘You have plenty of time to go to Fenchurch
Street and take your ticket, before the office
closes. I will expect you at eight, at my
lodgings, to hear how you have got on.’</p>

<p>At a few minutes past eight MacGowan
made his appearance at Beattie’s rooms. He
was sober, but to Beattie’s shrewd eye it was
evident that he had been taking something
in honour of the impending change in his
fortunes. This, however, was only what
might have been expected.</p>

<p>‘Have you got your passage-ticket?’ began
Beattie, rather sharply.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir,’ answered MacGowan, handing
over a piece of paper. ‘I took <span class="lock">it——’</span></p>

<p>‘Why, how’s this?’ exclaimed Beattie;
‘this ticket is in the name of P.
Macartney!’</p>

<p>‘I was telling you, sir,’ answered
MacGowan in an injured tone, ‘that I
thought it better to take another name,
<span class="lock">and——’</span></p>

<p>‘And make a completely fresh start?
Quite right. You showed great good sense
in doing that, MacGowan. Much better to
break with the past altogether. But why on
earth did you take an Irish name, when
everybody can see you are a Scotchman?’</p>

<p>‘It’s a Scotch name, too,’ answered
MacGowan, in a slightly offended tone. ‘It
was my mother’s name. And my grandfather
was called Peter.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well; I don’t suppose it very
much matters,’ said Beattie, handing him
back the ticket. ‘When does the steamer
sail?’</p>

<p>‘To-morrow afternoon or evening, sir. We
are to be on board by four o’clock.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll come down and see you off. St.
Margaret’s Dock, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir; but it’s an awkward place to get
to, and a long way. I could call on you, Mr.
Beattie, at any place and hour you choose to
appoint.’</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ said Beattie, smiling. ‘I’ll meet
you at the ship. Will you take a glass of
wine before you go?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing, Mr. Beattie; nothing for me,’
said MacGowan, with a deprecatory wave of
the hand, turning away his head, as if to
avoid the very sight of temptation. And so
he took his leave.</p>

<p>‘Arrant humbug!’ exclaimed Beattie, as
his visitor left the house. ‘He’ll go straight
to a public-house. And he’ll drink himself to
death within a month after he lands. Perhaps
it would have been better if I had given him
a little money; but sooner or later it comes all
to the same thing.’</p>

<p>David MacGowan was waiting for his benefactor,
as the latter drove down to St.
Margaret’s Dock the following afternoon.</p>

<p>‘That’s the steamer, is it?’ said Beattie;
‘and a fine ship she is. I almost wish I were
going to Australia too, by Jove!’</p>

<p>MacGowan grinned faintly, as if the treat
of having Mr. Beattie as a companion were
too good to hope or pray for; and Beattie
plunged his hand into his pocket.</p>

<p>The hoarse cry of the steam fog-whistle was
already sounding for the last time.</p>

<p>‘There’s the money I promised to lend
you,’ said Beattie. ‘Count it, and see that
it’s all right.’</p>

<p>‘No need to do that, sir,’ murmured MacGowan.</p>

<p>‘I hope you’ll make a good use of it, and—prosper,
you know. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>MacGowan, after many expressions of
gratitude, went on board, and the steamer,
which was already crawling at a snail’s pace
past the wharf, slowly worked her way to the
entrance at the further end of the dock. With
the help of her tug she got quickly through
the dock-gates, and Beattie stood watching
her as she glided out into the river, until she
was hidden in the sea-mist and the gathering
darkness.</p>

</h3>
<h4>THE RICH MAN DIED, AND WAS BURIED.<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> a gloomy winter morning the invisible
hand was stretched forth, and James Lindsay
was taken behind the veil. Then hired people
came and went silently. The blinds were
drawn, and the house was almost in darkness.
The servants, knowing that little would be
expected of them, gathered round their fire
and told each other what steps they would
take to gain new places. Miss Lindsay informed
Mr. Hatchett of what had happened,
that he might seal up the dead man’s desk
and the drawers of his writing-table; and
Mr. Hatchett sent a trusty old clerk named
Drake, who had performed that service for
scores of deceased clients, to do what was
necessary. After Mr. Drake’s departure Miss
Lindsay locked the doors of the library, and
of the room where the dead man was lying,
and betook herself to her own room on the
third floor. Laura followed her example.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon Semple, finding that
existence at No. 21, Claremont Gardens was,
under the circumstances, an insupportable
burden, wandered off towards the City, leaving
word that he would not be back to
dinner.</p>

<p>About three in the afternoon Laura crept
downstairs, and finding that the drawing-room
fire was lighted, she sat down before it,
and wondered for the hundredth time that day
whether her guardian had left her anything in
his will. She wished Semple had not gone
out. She would have made him tell her.
She wished Alec would come, that she might
ask him—it would have been some relief, some
breach in the monotony, even to see him for
five minutes—but he did not come to the
house all day. As it happened, he was confined
to the house with influenza.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and Laura felt that she
could not stand it any longer. She went to
the library for a book, but the door was
locked. Then she put her hand on the bell,
meaning to send out one of the servants for a
novel; but before ringing she withdrew her
hand and went up to her own room. Very
quietly she put on her hat and boots. She
knew she was committing a breach of propriety,
and that was in great part the attraction
for her.</p>

<p>Slipping quietly, with an inward shudder,
past the chamber where death held his court,
she reached the hall, and in another minute
she was in the open air. The fog was thick,
but not too thick for her to find her way.</p>

<p>She knew that a few streets off there was
a station on the District Railway. There, at
least, she would find some distraction; there
would be something to look at, something to
listen to, instead of the dreadful stillness in
which she had spent the day. Wrapping her
cloak around her, she hurried on, enjoying the
motion and the cold air, though the fog was
stifling.</p>

<p>When she reached the station, she went to
the book-stall, and, carefully selecting two
novels which promised a fair share of mental
excitement and a society paper, she bought
them and slipped them under her cloak. Her
errand was now accomplished, but she was
unwilling yet to return to that great, dismal
house, so she sauntered for a few minutes up
and down the platform.</p>

<p>The place was chilly, draughty, and almost
deserted, and she was thinking of returning
home, when she heard the tinkle of an
electric bell and the rattle of an approaching
train. She stepped back into one of the
arched recesses in the wall, to wait until the
crowd of passengers, who were sure to alight,
had gone by.</p>

<p>Ten seconds more, and the deserted platform
was alive with people. First came the third-class
passengers—message-boys, porters,
work-girls, stout women with babies. Then a
scattered group of business men in heavy
overcoats. And among them was James
Semple. Not caring to be seen by him,
Laura stepped back as far as she could, but
she was in no danger, as she was in the
shadow, and her veil was down.</p>

<p>A man whom she did not recognise joined
Semple. They seemed to have been travelling
by the same train without knowing it.
The two men passed her, walking slowly on
account of the crowd, and conversing together
as they went.</p>

<p>‘And Alec Lindsay is ill?’ she heard
Semple say to his companion.</p>

<p>‘Yes; a bad cold, he says. I hope he
won’t be able to leave the house for a week,’
was the reply.</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Ah! you don’t understand. You think
we are in sight of land. Not yet. In
<span class="lock">fact——’</span></p>

<p>Laura could hear no more, for Semple and
Beattie (who was his companion) had passed
her. But her curiosity was excited. She
mingled with the crowd, and managed to get
a little nearer to the speaker. But Beattie
had dropped his voice, and she could only
catch the words—‘must not be there when
the will is read, on any account,’ when the
two men reached the door of exit, and
passed beyond her hearing.</p>

<p>There was nothing Laura Mowbray loved
so much as a secret. Here was one, she felt
sure. Who was not to be present when the
will was read? Alec Lindsay? They had
been talking of his illness just before. Why
should he not be present at the reading of the
will? It could make no difference to anyone,
surely, whether he was there or not.
Who was this stranger who was interested in
Mr. Lindsay’s will?</p>

<p>There was no solution, however, to these
questions; and Laura, after waiting a few
minutes to avoid any chance of meeting
Semple in the street, made the best of her
way home.</p>

<p>Semple, she found, had not arrived; nor
did he return until late in the evening. Miss
Lindsay, fortunately, was still upstairs. As
the evening advanced, however, she came
down, and ordered tea, in lieu of dinner, for
Laura and herself. Then she went to the
library and fetched two volumes of sermons,
one of which she gave to Laura, while she sat
down to study the other. One by one the
slow hours went by, till nine o’clock struck,
and then Laura went to bed, where she lay
reading ‘The Mystery of the Manor House,’ till
the cold compelled her to lay the book down.</p>

<p>Next day the dressmakers came with the
half-finished mourning dresses, and that was a
great relief; and so the time passed until the
day of the funeral.</p>

<p>It was a small and a melancholy company.
Mr. Hatchett was there, Mr. Beattie having
told him that the estate was a large one, and
it would be well that he should be on the
spot. The physician was there; also Mr.
Andrew Simpson and Mr. Nicol Carnegie,
two old friends of Mr. James Lindsay’s whom
he had named as his executors, and James
Semple, of course. Alec Lindsay was not
sufficiently recovered for the doctor to allow
him to attend the funeral; and his father was
deterred from making the long journey to
London by a sharp attack of rheumatism.
Dr. Mackenzie, however, had come from
Scotland, as well as a Dr. George Adamson,
who was one of the trustees for the Free
Kirk.</p>

<p>The clergyman at the cemetery hurried
over the last words of the prayers. Another
funeral was due in ten minutes, and the
curate was anxious to warm himself thoroughly
at the fire in the clerk’s office before
he began to read the service for the fourth
time that day.</p>

<p>Soon the dismal task was ended. James
Lindsay was laid in his native dust; and the
mourners felt relieved as they mounted the
steps of the mourning-coaches, to be driven
back to the house.</p>

<p>When they had all taken their seats in the
dining-room, which felt chilly in spite of a
roaring fire, wine and cake were handed
round, while Mr. Hatchett, who had brought
the will in the pocket of his overcoat, made a
formal search among James Lindsay’s papers
for another testament. He was still busy in
the library when Miss Lindsay and Laura
entered the dining-room.</p>

<p>Miss Mowbray walked slowly, with downcast
eyes. She knew that her mourning
dress was very becoming to her, and she
secretly determined to be often in mourning,
or half-mourning, at least, in the future.
Dr. Mackenzie met the two ladies, and conducted
Laura to a seat; while Mr. Carnegie,
an old acquaintance of Miss Lindsay’s, came
forward and led her to a chair.</p>

<p>‘This is a very sad event, Miss Mowbray,’
said Dr. Mackenzie, seating himself.</p>

<p>‘It is indeed,’ answered the girl in a subdued
tone, lifting her eyes for a moment to
the minister’s face.</p>

<p>‘And it is one which may happen to any
of us at any time. It is well to be prepared.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I am sure Mr. Lindsay was prepared
to die. He was so resigned, so peaceful
towards the close.’</p>

<p>This was said in Laura’s sweetest tone,
but it was not a satisfactory answer in the
ears of the Scottish Doctor of Divinity.</p>

<p>‘There is a false peace as well as a true
peace, Miss Mowbray,’ he said somewhat
severely. ‘I believe Mr. Lindsay’s peace
was well founded. He knew the way of
salvation. But a mere general trust in the
goodness of God is worthless—utterly worthless.’</p>

<p>This startled Laura, and, anxious to reassure
the minister, and to prevent the conversation
taking a more personal turn, she
said:</p>

<p>‘I have been reading such beautiful sermons
in a book Miss Lindsay gave me. I am sure
you would like them. They are by a Mr.
Robertson.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean Robertson of Brighton?’</p>

<p>Laura saw that she had made a mistake.</p>

<p>‘Ye—yes; I think so.’</p>

<p>‘Poison! Rank poison!’ cried the minister,
unconsciously raising his voice. ‘I cannot
understand Miss Lindsay putting such a book
into your hands, or into the hands of any
young person. I trust you did not agree
with that writer. But he is most seductive,
especially for the young. Did you read
many of the sermons?’</p>

<p>‘No.’ (This was true enough. Laura had
read about a page and a half of one of them.)
‘And I will not read any more of them,
since you do not approve of them. Have
you published any sermons, Dr. Mackenzie?’</p>

<p>‘I did—some time ago.’</p>

<p>‘I <em>thought</em> I had seen them somewhere,’
said Laura, knitting her brows as if she
were making a great effort of memory. ‘I
wish I knew where I could get a copy.’</p>

<p>‘I will send you a volume of them, if you
like,’ said the minister.</p>

<p>‘Oh, thank you <em>so</em> much!’ replied Laura,
with a look of gratitude.</p>

<p>‘How we misjudge people,’ said the minister
to himself. ‘I had thought this young lady
had been of a rather frivolous disposition;’
and he helped himself to another glass of port.</p>

<p>As he did so, Mr. Hatchett opened the
door, and proceeding to the top of the long
table, amid a universal silence, took his seat.</p>

<p>‘There seems to be no document of a
testamentary character, ladies and gentlemen,
among the papers of the deceased. This is a
will which he executed a few weeks ago. It
was drawn and engrossed at my office. With
your permission I will read it to you.’</p>

<p>When the lawyer finished his preface,
everybody assumed an attitude of polite indifference,
listening intently all the while.
Laura, who had not expected to understand
much of it, found that it was quite intelligible.
Her own name was among those of the
legatees.</p>

<p>‘And I leave and bequeath to my ward,
Laura Mowbray, the sum of two thousand
pounds.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it is always something; with what
I have I shall be independent, at any rate,’
said Laura to herself.</p>

<p>Then came one or two other small legacies,
and then the lawyer proceeded:</p>

<p>‘And I leave and bequeath to the person
who shall be the Moderator of the Free
Church of Scotland at the time of my death,
and to all the persons then surviving who
shall have filled that office, and to every
person who shall hereafter fill that office, the
sum of five thousand pounds in <span class="lock">trust——’</span></p>

<p>A hoarse, inarticulate cry had burst from
Dr. Mackenzie’s lips.</p>

<p>The lawyer stopped and looked at him.</p>

<p>‘Read that again if you please, sir,’ said
the minister, in a hard, stern voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Hatchett eyed him for a moment before
he bent again over the paper.</p>

<p>‘And I leave and bequeath to the person
who shall be the Moderator of the Free
Church of Scotland at the time of my death,
and to all the persons then surviving who
shall have filled that office, and to every
person who shall hereafter fill that office, the
sum of five thousand pounds in trust <span class="lock">for——’</span></p>

<p>‘There is some mistake here,’ said Dr.
Mackenzie, rising and going up to the table.</p>

<p>The lawyer contemptuously pushed the
paper under the minister’s eyes and pointed
silently to the words. Yes; there they were
plainly—five thousand pounds. Dr. Adamson
came up behind, and having with trembling
fingers put his spectacles on his nose, he
peered into the paper, and satisfied himself
that the words were ‘five thousand pounds’
beyond any possibility of doubt.</p>

<p>Dr. Mackenzie was trembling with anxiety
and passion. It was not only that an annual
sum which would have doubled his income
was lost to him; nor was it only the injury
done to his Church that moved him; he felt
that both he and the cause which he had
at heart had been shamefully defrauded.</p>

<p>He looked at the signatures of the witnesses.
They were, or appeared to be, the same as
when he had seen them affixed. The date
was correct. There was no appearance of
erasure, no possibility that the words had
been tampered with.</p>

<p>While the minister had been examining the
will there was a deep silence. He now laid
it on the table, and leaning one hand upon it,
said in a grave tone:</p>

<p>‘All I can say is that my deceased friend
expressed his intention to me of leaving half
a million of money to the Church of which I
am a member. He consulted me on the subject.
He showed me a draft of the will, in
which that sum <em>was</em> so <span class="lock">left——’</span></p>

<p>‘In figures, or in words, sir?’ asked the
lawyer sharply.</p>

<p>‘I think it was both in words and in figures.
But the draft can be sent for, and it will
be found to bear me out. And more than
that, I heard Mr. Lindsay’s nephew read the
will to him before he signed it, and the sum
he read was five <em>hundred</em> thousand pounds.</p>

<p>‘There I think you are mistaken, Dr.
Mackenzie.’</p>

<p>It was James Semple who spoke. He had
not risen. He was very pale. His left arm
remained folded across his breast; with his
right hand he was pulling his moustache.
Laura gazed at him curiously.</p>

<p>‘What, sir!’ shouted Dr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p>‘I only say that you are mistaken in
thinking that my cousin read what you say
he did. As to my uncle’s intentions I know
nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think, sir, that I, knowing my
friend’s intentions, would have heard a will
contrary to those intentions read out to him
before signature, without saying a word of
protest, or asking any explanation?’ cried the
minister.</p>

<p>‘And do you think <em>I</em> would have said
nothing if such a monstrous bequest had been
in the will?’ retorted Semple.</p>

<p>‘Come, come, gentlemen,’ said Mr.
Hatchett, who had been listening carefully to
all that had passed. ‘Mr. Alexander Lindsay
doubtless read what was in the will; and the
will is here to speak for itself. I think I had
better finish reading it.’</p>

<p>He did so, and when he had finished, Dr.
Mackenzie said excitedly:</p>

<p>‘We do not accept that document as a true
exponent of the testator’s wishes. We protest—eh,
Dr. Adamson?—we protest against
it. We shall appeal to the law-courts.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, gentlemen,’ said Mr. Hatchett
politely; ‘all shall be done in a correct and
orderly manner. You will select your own
solicitors, whom I shall be happy to meet.
Meanwhile, Mr. Carnegie, and Mr.—er—Simpson,
you accept the executorship and
trusteeship, as I understand?’</p>

<p>The two gentlemen, who knew enough of
the world to know what this meant, yielded a
melancholy assent. Miss Lindsay, seeing
that there was no need for her further
presence, made a sign to Laura Mowbray;
and the two ladies left the room together.</p>

<p>‘And I will apply for probate, I presume,
in the usual way,’ remarked Mr. Hatchett,
rubbing his hands gently, with much inward
satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘I have one suggestion to make, gentlemen,’
he said, ‘before we separate. I believe
the domestics who signed the will as witnesses
are in the house. It would be well to
summon them now, before they have been
led to suppose that anything can depend on
what they may have to say, and ask them
in your presence whether they can swear
that these are their signatures.’</p>

<p>The suggestion was received with a
murmur of applause, and some one rang
the bell. Meantime, Dr. Mackenzie asked a
question.</p>

<p>‘If I remember aright,’ he said, ‘the
other legacies bequeathed in the will are
of comparatively small value, perhaps not
more than twenty or thirty thousand pounds
in all?’</p>

<p>Mr. Hatchett bowed.</p>

<p>‘Then who takes all the money?’</p>

<p>‘With regard to any property not specifically
mentioned,’ said Mr. Hatchett, glancing
once more at the document before him, ‘it
goes to the residuary legatees.’</p>

<p>‘And they are?’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Alexander Lindsay is one of them,’
said the lawyer, while a grave look came into
his face.</p>

<p>He was stopped by the entrance of the
servants, and James Semple was glad, somehow,
that Mr. Hatchett did not go on to
recite his name. It would have weakened
the effect of his contradiction of the minister’s
recollection, although, of course, the whole
world must soon know how the matter
stood. But as the words ‘Mr. Alexander
Lindsay is one of them’ fell from Mr.
Hatchett’s lips, a certain thrill ran through
the little company.</p>

<p>The servants declared without hesitation
that the document before them was the one
they had signed, that and no other; and then
everybody rose up and prepared to go.</p>

<p>Miss Lindsay went up to Dr. Mackenzie as
he passed into the hall, with the intention
of offering him hospitality, but as she was
on the point of speaking to him, Semple
interrupted her, affecting not to see the
minister, and speaking in a loud whisper:</p>

<p>‘My dear aunt, don’t you think that after
what has happened to-day Dr. Mackenzie
would be more comfortable at an hotel?’</p>

<p>The minister reddened and involuntarily
clenched his fists.</p>

<p>To do James Semple justice, this piece
of rudeness was not a mere wanton insult.
William Beattie had carefully instructed him
that Alec Lindsay and the justly infuriated
minister were not to be allowed to meet; and
Semple thought it quite possible that if Dr.
Mackenzie were staying in the house he
might get Alec’s address from his aunt and
go to him at once.</p>

<p>The minister, holding his chin very high in
the air, sent for a cab, and drove off with his
friend, Dr. Adamson, in search of an hotel.
As they jolted along one subject jostled with
the great question of the will in the minister’s
mind, sometimes altogether ousting it from
his attention. Would it be fair, he was
asking himself, for him to charge Dr. Adamson’s
expenses as well as his own to the trust,
if it should turn out to be five thousand
pounds only, as he might unquestionably
have done if the legacy had been one of half
a million? And if not, seeing that he had
asked Dr. Adamson to take what was really
an unnecessary journey to London, and considering
that his colleague’s family was twice
as large as his own, would it not be incumbent
upon him in equity to pay those expenses out
of his, Dr. Mackenzie’s, own pocket? An
Englishman would probably not have raised
either point in the tribunal of his conscience.
Dr. Mackenzie not only raised them, but
argued them, and finally decided them against
himself, consoling himself as he did so with
that remarkably Scotch proverb, ‘It’s not lost
that a friend gets.’</p>

<p>But the sum could ill be spared; and the
loss of it did not tend to diminish his resentment
against those defrauders of the temple,
as Dr. Mackenzie considered them, James
Lindsay’s nephews.</p>
